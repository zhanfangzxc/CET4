Have we still got a budget problem?\nM：I don’t know. I hope not. The meeting’s on Friday. But that’s not what I want to talk to you about. Er...close the door, will you? It’s Marsha.\nW: Marsha? What about her?\nM：I’m worried. I don’t know what to do. She’s just not performing. We may have to let her go.\nW: Fire her? She’s been with us a long time, Bob. If she leaves, it’ll be a big loss to us. She’s done really excellent work.\nM：Yes. But lately, the last month or so, in fact, there have been a lot of problems. She’s changed. Not only does she have a tendency to be moody all the time, but she misses appointments, doesn’t follow through on projects, and doesn’t seem to plan anything till the last minute.\nW: Um, did she ever explain why she didn’t show up for the Denver trip?\nM: No. She said she was sorry and that it wouldn’t happen again. Something about a mix-up on arrangements to get to the airport. Now, whenever anybody mentions the subject to her, she just goes silent. I don’t know. Thank goodness. David pulled us out of the hole on that one.\nW: Yes, he did a really fine job, filling in for Marsha like that at the last minute.\nM: I don’t think it was the first time he’s had to do that. If we knew all the facts, I think we’d find that he’s been covering for Marsha on quite a few projects.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20131202/201312(2)C1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":103332,"title":"What did the man do before he came to see the woman?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n女士话中You sounded pretty serious on the phone，“你刚才在电话里听起来好严肃”，与C选项中的talked to her on the phone，“在电话里谈过话”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He made a business trip."},{"option":2,"content":"He had a quarrel with Marsha."},{"option":3,"content":"He talked to her on the phone."},{"option":4,"content":"He resolved a budget problem."}]},{"id":103333,"title":"What does the man say about Marsha?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词just之后not performing，“表现不好”；和We may have to let her go，“我们也许得让她离开了”，与A选项中的She may have to be fired for poor performance，“她有可能因为糟糕的表现而被解雇”构成同义替换，即A为正确选项","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"She may have to be fired for poor performance."},{"option":2,"content":"She has developed some serious mental problem."},{"option":3,"content":"She is in charge of the firm’s budget planning."},{"option":4,"content":"She supervises a number of important projects."}]},{"id":103334,"title":"How did Marsha explain why she didn’t show up for the Denver trip?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n男生话中a mix-up on arrangements to get to the airport，“去机场的时间安排出现了混乱”，与A选项中的failed to arrive at the airport on time，“没能按时到机场”构成同义替换。从男士的话中，可以得知Marsha说她没有参加丹佛之行的原因是去机场的时间安排出现了错乱，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"She failed to arrive at the airport on time."},{"option":2,"content":"David promised to go on the trip in her place."},{"option":3,"content":"Something unexpected happened at her home."},{"option":4,"content":"She was not feeling herself on that day."}]},{"id":103335,"title":"What does the man say about David?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词if之后he’s been covering for Marsha on quite a few projects，“他在好几个项目中掩盖过Marsha的过失”，与C选项中的He has been trying hard to cover for Marsha，“他在努力掩盖Marsha的过失”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He frequently gets things mixed up."},{"option":2,"content":"He is always finding fault with Marsha."},{"option":3,"content":"He has been trying hard to cover for Marsha."},{"option":4,"content":"He often fails to follow through on his projects."}]}]},{"id":5299,"name":"2013.12 (Conversation Two 卷二)","content":"M: You also head the mistresses of Oxford high school for girls. How many girls do you have here?\nW: We have 650 girls.\nM: In your experience, do girls do better academically and later professionally in single-sex schools?\nW: Yes. I think they do better academically and you can measure that very crudely from the examination results. I also think they do better academically because they have full opportunity to take the leading role in discussions and in managerial responsibilities. I think they see the role models of the chief positions in the school being held by women.\nM：I wonder if you could say then in a few words what the advantages are for a girl at a single-sex school.\nW: Well, I think within the classroom, she’s going to have full opportunity to express her own opinions. She isn’t going to be shouted down by over-confident young gentlemen.\nM：Are teenagers in particular, do you think, sheltered too much from contact with the opposite sex? Does this cause them difficulties when they find themselves in mixed groups?\nW: Well, I would like to find the parents who could shelter girls from the opposite sex if they live in Oxford. They encounter boys all the time socially out of school, and through debating societies and things like that, some school activities as well.\nM：So, no disadvantages at all?\nW: I don’t think there are any disadvantages. I think that it’s grossly overstated that one needs to have contact with the opposite sex right through the whole of life, in the classroom and outside the classroom and at all ages.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20131202/201312(2)C2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":103336,"title":"What does the woman say about the girls in her school?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词because之后they have full opportunity to take the leading role，“她们有充分的机会去担当领导角色”，与C选项中的They have more opportunities to develop their leadership skills，“她们有更多的机会去发展领导才能”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They are better sheltered from all the outside temptations."},{"option":2,"content":"They are usually more motivated to compete with their peers."},{"option":3,"content":"They have more opportunities to develop their leadership skills."},{"option":4,"content":"They take an active part in more extracurricular activities."}]},{"id":103337,"title":"What do we learn about the woman’s school?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n女士话中chief positions in the school being held by women，“学校里的主要职位由女性来担任”，与A选项中的chief positions are held by women构成视听一致，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Its chief positions are held by women."},{"option":2,"content":"Its teaching staff consists of women only."},{"option":3,"content":"Its students aim at managerial posts."},{"option":4,"content":"Its students are role models of women."}]},{"id":103338,"title":"What does the woman say about the girls’ social life?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n女士话中They encounter boys all the time socially out of school，“她们在校外的社交场合随时有机会和男孩接触”，与D选项中的They have ample opportunities to meet the opposite sex，“她们有机会和异性接触”构成同义替换。女士说她们的女学生在校外的社交活动、辩论会以及其他的学校活动中都有机会和男生接触，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is under adequate control."},{"option":2,"content":"t is traditional but colorful."},{"option":3,"content":"They are more or less isolates from the outside world."},{"option":4,"content":"They have ample opportunities to meet the opposite sex."}]}]}]}
