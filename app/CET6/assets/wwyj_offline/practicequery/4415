Hard because there’s no conclusive definition of poverty. Low income matters, though how low is unclear. Poverty is also a state of mind that fosters self-defeating behavior—bad work habits, family breakdowns, and additions. Finally, poverty results from bad luck: accidents, job losses, disability.\n    Despite poverty’s messiness, we’ve measured progress against it by a single statics: the federal poverty line. By this measure, we haven’t made much progress. But the apparent lack of progress is misleading for two reasons.\n    First, it ignores immigration. Many immigrants are poor and low skilled. They add to the poor. From 1989 to 2007, about three quarters of the increase in the poverty population occurred among Hispanics(西班牙裔美国人)—mostly immigrants and their children.\n    Second, the poor’s material well-being has improved. The official poverty measure obscures this by counting only pre-tax cash income and ignoring other sources of support, including food stamps and housing subsidies. Although many poor live from hand to mouth, they’ve participated in rising living standards. In 2005, 91% had microwaves, 79% air-conditioning, and 48% cell phones.\n    The existing poverty line could be improved by adding some income resource and subtracting some expenses. Unfortunately, the administration’s proposal for a “supplemental poverty measures” in 2011 goes beyond that. The new poverty number would compound public confusion. It also raises questions about whether the statics is tailored to favor a political agenda.\n    The “supplemental measures” ties the poverty threshold to what the poorest third of Americans spend on food, housing, clothing, and utilities. The actual threshold will probably be higher than today’s poverty line. Many Americans would find this weird: people get richer, but “poverty”stays stuck.\n    What produces this outcome is a different view of poverty. The present concept is an absolute one: the poverty threshold reflects the amount estimated to meet basic needs. By contrast, the new measure embraces a relative notion of poverty: people are automatically poor if they’re given distance from the top, even if their income are increasing.\n    The new indicator is a “propaganda device” to promote income redistribution by showing that poverty is stubborn or increasing. The Census Bureau has estimated statics similar to the administration’s proposal. In 2008, the traditional poverty rate was 13.2%; estimates of the new statics range up to 17%. The new poverty statistic exceeds the old, and the gap grows larger over time.\n    As senator Daniel Moynihan said, the administration is defining poverty up. It’s legitimate to debate how much we should aid the poor or reduce economic inequality. But the debate should not be swayed by misleading statistics that few Americans could possibly understand. Government statistics should strive for political neutrality(中立). This one fails.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103140,"title":"What is the main idea of the first paragraph?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的the first paragraph定位至文章首段。\n解析：文章第一段第三句说Hard because there’s no conclusive definition of poverty，“因为贫困没有明确的定义，所以很难回答什么是贫困”。接下来的三句分别从收入高低、心理状态和运气好坏三个方面来解释为什么贫困难以界定。由此可知，第一段的中心意思是说大家在贫困的定义上没有达成共识。故D选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Poverty is very often defined as a state of mind."},{"option":2,"content":"Poverty is a problem hard to tackle in America."},{"option":3,"content":"Bad work habits and bad luck lead to poverty."},{"option":4,"content":"There is no consensus on the concept of poverty."}]},{"id":103141,"title":"What does the author say about the poor in America?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的the poor定位到文中第四段第一句。\n解析： 定位句说Second, the poor’s material well-being has improved，“穷人的物质生活已经得到改善”，可知穷人的生活水平提高了，故A选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Their living standards have actually improved."},{"option":2,"content":"Most of them are immigrants and their descendants."},{"option":3,"content":"Their chances of rising above the poverty line are slim."},{"option":4,"content":"Most of them rely on government subsidies for survival."}]},{"id":103142,"title":"What does the author think of administration’s proposal for a “supplemental poverty measure”?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干的supplemental poverty measures定位到文章第五段第二句。\n解析：定位句说政府提出的贫困补充措施提高了贫困线的门槛。第五段最后一句说，It also raises questions about whether the statics is tailored to favor a political agenda，“人们质疑该措施是为了支持某一政治议程而量身定做”。也就是说这一标准可能是为某种政治目服务的，故B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is intended to further help the poor."},{"option":2,"content":"It is made to serve political purposes."},{"option":3,"content":"It is a positive response to changed circumstances."},{"option":4,"content":"It is an attempt to combat the economic recession."}]},{"id":103143,"title":"What is the characteristics of the new measure of poverty?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的characteristic 和new measure定位到文章第七段最后一句。\n解析：定位句指出，the new measure embraces a relative notion of poverty: people are automatically poor if they’re given distance from the top，“”新的计算方法采用了相对贫困的概念：即使穷人的收入在增加，但是如果他们与富裕阶层的差距达到某一特定值，他们就会自动被归类贫困人口。也就是说贫困是根据贫富之间的差距来界定的，故A选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It defines poverty by the gap between the rich and the poor."},{"option":2,"content":"It raises the threshold for the poor to get welfare benefits."},{"option":3,"content":"It is more accurate and scientific in terms of statistics."},{"option":4,"content":"It truly reflects the practical needs of the poor."}]},{"id":103144,"title":"What does the author want to say by quoting Daniel Moynihan?","textExplain":"定位：由题干的Daniel Moynihan定位到文章最后一段。\n解析：最后一段最后两句话说，Government statistics should strive for political neutrality(中立).

Along with lectures on finance and entrepreneurship and the like, the program included a delightfully out-of-place session with AL Filreis, an English professor at the University of Pennsylvania, on poetry.\n    For three hours he talked us through “The Red Wheelbarrow” and “Stopping by Woods on a Showy Evening”. The experience——especially when contrasted with the horrible prose of our other assigned reading——sent me fleeing to the campus bookstore, where I resumed a long-interrupted romance with meter and rhyme.\n    Professor Filreis says that he is “a little shock” at how intensely his Wharton students respond to this unexpected deviation from the business, not just as a relief but as a kind of stimulus. Many write afterward asking him to recommend books of poetry. Especially now.\n    “The grim economy seems to make the participants keener than ever to think ‘out of the box’ in the way poetry encourages,” he told me.\n    Which brings me to Congress, an institution stuck deeper inside the box than just about any other these days. You have probably heard that up on Capital Hill, they’re very big on prayer breakfast, where members gather over scrambled eggs and ask God for wisdom. Well, maybe it’s time to add some poetry readings to the agenda.\n    I’m not suggesting that poetry will guide our legislators to wisdom any more than prayer has. Just that it might make them a little more human. Poetry is no substitute for courage or competence, but properly applied, it is a challenge to self-certainty, which we currently have in excess. Poetry serves as a spur to creative thinking, a reproach to dogma and habit, a remedy to the current fashion for pledge signing.\n    The poet Shelley, in defense of poetry nearly two centuries ago, wrote, “A man, to be greatly good, must imagine intensely and comprehensively; he must put himself in the place of another and of many others; the pains and pleasures of his species must become his own.” Shelley concludes that essay by calling poets “the unacknowledged legislators of the world,” because they bring imagination to the realm of “reasoners and mechanists.”\n    The relevance of poetry was declared more concisely in five lines from the love poem “Asphodel, That Greeny Flower,” by William Carlos William:\n   It is difficult\n   to get the news from poems\n   yet men die miserably every day\n   for lack\n   of what is found there.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103145,"title":"Why did the author participate in the Wharton School management program?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的Wharton School management program定位到文章首段第一句。\n解析：定位句说I was sent to a management program at the Wharton School to be prepared for bigger things，“为了给更加重要的事情做准备，我参加沃顿商学院参加管理培训项目”。即作者去沃顿商学院接受培训是为了更加重要的工作岗位，故B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He was a passionate lover of classical poetry."},{"option":2,"content":"He was being trained for an important position."},{"option":3,"content":"He had just been promoted to top management."},{"option":4,"content":"He was interested in finance and entrepreneurship."}]},{"id":103146,"title":"What did the author think of Professor Filreis’s poetry session?","textExplain":"和第二段。\n解析：第一段最后一句提到Professor Filreis的诗歌课，第二段作者说该教授的诗歌课让作者重温了对诗歌的喜爱，说明作者很喜欢教授的诗歌课；第三段第一句借教授的话说学生们对这门课的反应都很热烈。可知作者认为教授的课对学生很有吸引力，即C选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It diverted students’ attention from the assigned reading."},{"option":2,"content":"It made the management program appear romantic."},{"option":3,"content":"It was extremely appealing to the students."},{"option":4,"content":"It pulled students out of prose reading sessions."}]},{"id":103147,"title":"What was the impact of the poetry session on the program participants according to Professor Filreis?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中的participant定位到文章第四段。\n解析：定位段中The grim economy seems to make the participants keener than ever to think ‘out of the box’ in the way poetry encourages，“惨淡的经济使得学员们渴望打破固定的思维模式，以诗歌的方式进行思考”。也就是说诗歌鼓励学员们从更广阔的角度思考问题，故A选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It inspired them to view things from broader perspectives."},{"option":2,"content":"It led them to think poetry indispensable to management."},{"option":3,"content":"It helped them develop a keener interest in literate."},{"option":4,"content":"It encouraged them to embark on a political career."}]},{"id":103148,"title":"What  does the author  think of Capital Hill’s prayer over breakfast?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的prayer over breakfast定位到文章第五段。\n解析：定位段中，作者说国会比其它任何机构都深陷在固定的思维模式中，这里的人看重早餐时的祈祷，希望从上帝那里得到智慧以解决问题，也许他们应该把阅读诗歌列入日程。作者用讽刺的语言表示国会的人的早餐祷告其实对经济问题毫无帮助，即B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is a ritual that has lost its original meaning."},{"option":2,"content":"It doesn’t really help solve the economic problems."},{"option":3,"content":"It provides inspiration as poetry reading does."},{"option":4,"content":"It helps people turn away from the debt spectacle."}]},{"id":103149,"title":"What do we learn from Shelley’s essay?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的Shelley定位到文章第七段。\n解析：第七段作者引用雪莱的诗，A man, to be greatly good, must imagine intensely and comprehensively; he must put himself in the place of another and of many others; the pains and pleasures of his species must become his own，“一个真正伟大的人，必须具备强大的想象力和理解力，必须能够体会别人的苦乐”。也就是强调想象力和同理心的都是十分重要的，故D选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Poetry can relieve people of pains and sufferings."},{"option":2,"content":"It takes poetic imagination to become a legislator."},{"option":3,"content":"Legislators should win public acknowledgment."},{"option":4,"content":"It is important to be imaginative and sympathetic."}]}]}]}
