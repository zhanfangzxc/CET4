Despite poverty’s messiness, we’ve measured progress against it by a single statics: the federal poverty line. By this measure, we haven’t made much progress. But the apparent lack of progress is misleading for two reasons.\n    First, it ignores immigration. Many immigrants are poor and low skilled. They add to the poor. From 1989 to 2007, about three quarters of the increase in the poverty population occurred among Hispanics(西班牙裔美国人)—mostly immigrants and their children.\n    Second, the poor’s material well-being has improved. The official poverty measure obscures this by counting only pre-tax cash income and ignoring other sources of support, including food stamps and housing subsidies. Although many poor live from hand to mouth, they’ve participated in rising living standards. In 2005, 91% had microwaves, 79% air-conditioning, and 48% cell phones.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103233,"title":"What does the author say about the poor in America?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的the poor定位到文中第四段第一句。\n解析： 定位句说Second, the poor’s material well-being has improved，“穷人的物质生活已经得到改善”，可知穷人的生活水平提高了，故A选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/cet6/CET6_reading_video/020_CET6_xijielianxi1.mp4","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Their living standards have actually improved."},{"option":2,"content":"Most of them are immigrants and their descendants."},{"option":3,"content":"Their chances of rising above the poverty line are slim."},{"option":4,"content":"Most of them rely on government subsidies for survival."}]}]},{"id":5196,"name":"2012.12.58 (卷二)","content":"...
