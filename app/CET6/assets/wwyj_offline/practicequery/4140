Surgeons may survive the robot invasion, but others at the hospital might not be so lucky, as iRobot, maker of the Roomba, a robot vacuum cleaner, has been showing off Ava, which could be used as a messenger in a hospital. And once you’re home, recovering, Ava could let you talk to your doctor, so there’s no need to send someone to your house. That “mobile telepresence” could be useful at the office. If you’re away on a trip, you can still attend a meeting. Just connect via videoconferencing software, so your face appears on Ava’s screen.\n    Is any job safe? I was hoping to say “journalist,” but researchers are already developing software that can gather facts and write a news story. Which means that a few years from now, a robot could be writing this column. And who will read it? Well, there might be a lot of us hanging around with lots of free time on our hands.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":582,"title":"What does the author imply about robotics?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的the author和imply定位到文章最后一段\n解析：最后一段作者说他曾经设想过或许新闻行业可以避免使用机器人，but researchers are already developing software that can gather facts and write a news story，“但是研究人员已经在开发能够收集材料和写新闻稿的软件了”。由此可见，作者暗示机器人可以被应用到所有能够想象到的领域。","videoExplainUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/cet6/CET6_reading_video/034_CET6_tuililianxi.mp4","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It will greatly enrich literary creation."},{"option":2,"content":"It will start a new technological revolution."},{"option":3,"content":"It will revolutionize scientific research."},{"option":4,"content":"It will be applied in any field imaginable."}]}]},{"id":3095,"name":"2009.12.58","content":"... Primary care should be the backbone of any health care system. Countries with appropriate primary care resources score highly when it comes to health outcomes and cost. The U. S. takes the opposite approach by emphasizing the specialist rather than the primary care physician. \n    A recent study analyzed the providers who treat Medicare beneficiaries（老年医保受惠人）. The startling finding was that the average Medicare patient saw a total of seven doctors—two primary care physicians and five specialists—in a given year. Contrary to popular belief, the more physicians taking care of you don’t guarantee better care. Actually, increasing fragmentation of care results in a corresponding rise in cost and medical errors.
