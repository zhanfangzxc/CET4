I can’t seem to get anyone in the hospital to listen to my complaints and this outdated equipment is dangerous. Just look at it.\nM: [19]Hmm, uh, are you trying to say that it presents a health hazard?\nW: Yes, I am. The head technician in the lab tried to persuade the hospital administration to replace it, but they are trying to cut costs.\nM: You are pregnant, aren’t you?\nW: Yes, I am. [20]I made an effort to get my supervisor to transfer me to another department, but he urged me not to complain too loudly. Because the administration is more likely to replace me than the X-ray equipment. I’m afraid to refuse to work, but I’m more afraid to expose my unborn child to the radiation.\nM: I see what you mean. Well, as your union representative, I have to warn you that it would take quite a while to force management to replace the old machines and attempt to get you transferred may or may not be successful.\nW: Oh, what am I supposed to do then?\nM: Workers have the legal rights to refuse certain unsafe work assignments under two federal laws: the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the National Labor Relations Act. [21]But the requirements of either of the Acts may be difficult to meet.\nW: Do you think I have a good case?\nM: [22]If you do lose your job, the union will fight to get it back for you along with back pay--your lost income. But you have to be prepared for a long wait, maybe up to two years.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20121201/201212(1)C1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102648,"title":"What does the woman complain about?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n文章开头处health hazard“健康危险”，与A选项health hazard构成视听一致。女士投诉的内容是她工作的场所设备陈旧，会有健康隐患，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The health hazard at her work place."},{"option":2,"content":"Poor management of the hospital."},{"option":3,"content":"Decisions made by the head technician."},{"option":4,"content":"The outdated medical testing procedures."}]},{"id":102649,"title":"What has the woman asked her supervisor to do?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n女士话中transfer me to another department“把我调到其他部门”，与A选项Transfer her to another department构成视听一致。女士曾要求主管人员把她调到其他部门，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Transfer her to another department."},{"option":2,"content":"Repair the x-ray equipment."},{"option":3,"content":"Cut down her workload."},{"option":4,"content":"Allow her to go on leave for two months."}]},{"id":102650,"title":"What does the man say about the two federal laws?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词But后面requirements … difficult to meet“很难达到要求”，与D选项“requirements … difficult to meet”构成视听一致。男士说这两个法令的要求都很难达到，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They are virtually impossible to enforce."},{"option":2,"content":"Neither is applicable to the woman’s ease."},{"option":3,"content":"Both of them have been subject to criticism."},{"option":4,"content":"Their requirements may be difficult to meet."}]},{"id":102651,"title":"What will the union do if the woman loses her job?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词if后面get it back“要回（工作）”，与C选项get it back构成视听一致。男士说如果女士因为投诉而失去工作的话，公会将帮助她讨还公道，要回工作，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Organize a mass strike."},{"option":2,"content":"Compensate for her loss."},{"option":3,"content":"Try to help her get it back."},{"option":4,"content":"Find her a better paying job."}]}]},{"id":4643,"name":"2012.12 (Conversation Two 卷一)","content":"W: Mr. Green, is it fair to say that negotiation is an art?\nM: Well, I think it’s both an art and science. [23]You can prepare for a negotiation quite scientifically, but the execution of the negotiation has quite a lot to do with one’s artistic quality. The scientific part of a negotiation is in determining your strategy. What do you want out of it? What can you give? Then of course there are tactics. How do you go about it? Do you take an opening position in a negotiation which differs from the eventual goal you are heading for? And then of course there are the behavioral aspects.\nW: What do you mean by the behavioral aspects?\nM: Well, that’s I think where the art comes in. In your behavior, you can either be an actor. [24]You can pretend that you don’t like things which you are actually quite pleased about. Or you can pretend to like things which you are quite happy to do without. Or you can be the honest type negotiator who’s known to his partners in negotiation and always plays everything straight. But the artistic part of negotiation I think has to do with responding immediately to cues one gets in the process of negotiation. These can be verbal cues or even body language. This is where the artistic quality comes in.\nW: So really, you see two types of negotiator then, the actor or the honest one.\nM: That’ right. [25]And both can work. I would say the honest negotiator can be quite effective in some circumstances. In other circumstances you need an actor.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20121201/201212(1)C2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102652,"title":"When is a scientific approach best embodied in a negotiation according to the man?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n文章开头处prepare for a negotiation quite scientifically“以科学的方式做好谈判的准备工作”，与D选项preparatory phase“准备阶段”构成同义替换。男士认为，谈判的准备过程中最能体现出科学方法，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"In giving concessions."},{"option":2,"content":"In the concluding part."},{"option":3,"content":"In stating your terms."},{"option":4,"content":"In the preparatory phase."}]},{"id":102653,"title":"In what way is a negotiator like an actor according to the man?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n男士说pretend that you don’t like things which you are actually quite pleased about“对于实际上非常喜欢的东西，假装不喜欢”，与A选项behaves in a way contrary to his real intention“表现出来的与其真实意图相反”构成同义替换。演员型谈判人员的表现往往与其真实意图相反，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He behaves in a way contrary to his real intention."},{"option":2,"content":"He presents his arguments in a straightforward way."},{"option":3,"content":"He responds readily to the other party’s proposals."},{"option":4,"content":"He uses lots of gestures to help make his points clear."}]},{"id":102654,"title":"What does the man say about the two types of negotiator?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n文章结尾处both can work“两种类型的谈判人员都能成功”，与C选项Both can succeed构成同义替换。男士说在不同的情况下，两种类型的谈判人员都有可能成功，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Both may fail when confronting experienced rivals."},{"option":2,"content":"The honest type is more effective than the actor type."},{"option":3,"content":"Both can succeed depending on the specific situation."},{"option":4,"content":"The actor type works better in tough negotiations."}]}]}]}
