The question will confront New Yorkers in February as the city's first robotic parking opens in Chinatown.\n    [26]The technology has been successfully applied overseas, but the only other public robotic garage in the United States has been troublesome, dropping vehicles and trapping cars because of technical problems.\n    [27]Nonetheless, the developers of the Chinatown garage are confident with the technology and are counting on it to squeeze 67 cars in an apartment-building basement that would otherwise fit only 24, accomplished by removing a maneuver space normally required.\n    A human-shaped robot won't be stepping into your car to drive it. Rather, the garage itself does the parking. The driver stops the car on a flat platform and gets out. The platform is lowered into the garage, and it is then transported to a vacant parking space by a computer-controlled device similar to an elevator that also runs sideways.\n    [28]There is no human supervision, but an attendant will be on hand to accept cash and explain the system to newly users. [29]Parking rates will be attractive, about $400 monthly or $25 per day, according to Ari Milstein, the director of planning for Automation Parking Systems, which is the U.S. subsidiary of a German company. This company has built automated garages in several countries overseas and in the United States for residents of a Washington, D.C. apartment building.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20130601/20136(1)P1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102773,"title":"What do we learn about the robot parking in the U.S. so far?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词but后面troublesome“棘手的”，与A选项not … very successful“不是很成功”构成同义替换。机器人停车技术在海外已成功付诸使用，但美国的一家采用该技术的停车场却因技术问题麻烦不断，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It has not been very successful."},{"option":2,"content":"It has long become a new trend."},{"option":3,"content":"It has met with strong resistance."},{"option":4,"content":"It has attracted a lot of users."}]},{"id":102774,"title":"What advantage does robotic parking have according to the developers?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词only处squeeze 67 cars“塞进67辆车”，otherwise fit only 24“不使用该技术只能容纳24辆车”，与B选项increases parking capacity“提高停车场容量”构成同义替换，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It saves time."},{"option":2,"content":"It increases parking capacity."},{"option":3,"content":"It ensures drivers’ safety."},{"option":4,"content":"It reduces car damage."}]},{"id":102775,"title":"What does the attendant do in the automated garage?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词but后面accept cash and explain the system to newly users“收取现金并向新手用户解释该系统”，与A选项Collect money and help new users“收钱和帮助新手用户”构成同义替换，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Collect money and help new users."},{"option":2,"content":"Maintain the automated system."},{"option":3,"content":"Stay alert to any emergency."},{"option":4,"content":"Walk around and guard against car theft."}]},{"id":102776,"title":"What does the company say about the parking rate?","textExplain":"本题考点为合理推测。\n根据文章结尾处$400 monthly or $25 per day“每月400美元或每天25美元”，可推知按月缴费比按日缴费便宜，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They will vary with the size of vehicles."},{"option":2,"content":"They will be discountable to regular customers."},{"option":3,"content":"They will be lower than conventional parking."},{"option":4,"content":"They will be reduced if paid in cash."}]}]},{"id":4768,"name":"2013.6 (Passage Two 卷一)","content":"    [30]A recent study shows that meat consumption is one of the main ways that human can damage the environment, second only to the use of motor vehicles. So how can eating meat have a negative effect on the environment? For a start, all animals, such as cows, pigs and sheep, always gas limed methane, which is the second most common green house gas after carbon dioxide. Many environmental experts now believe that methane is more responsible for global warming than carbon dioxide. It is estimated that 25% of all methane that released into the atmosphere coming from farm animals. Another way in which meat production affects the environment is through the use of water and land. 2,500 gallons of water are needed to produce one pound of beef Whereas 20 gallons of water are need to produce one pound of wheat. One acre of farmland used for raising cows can produce 250 pounds of beef. One acre of farmland used for crop production can produce 50,000 pounds of tomatoes. Many people now say the benefits of switching to vegetarian diet which excludes meat and fish. Not just for health reasons, but also because it plays a vital role in protecting the environment. [31]However, some nutritionists advise against switching to a totally strict vegetarian diet. They believe such a diet which includes no products from animal sources can be deficient in many of the necessary vitamins and minerals our bodies need. [32]Today many people have come to realize that help the environment and for the human race to survive, more of us will need to become vegetarian.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20130601/20136(1)P2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102777,"title":"What does the recent study show?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n文章开头处damage the environment“破坏环境”，与D选项has an adverse effect on the environment“对环境有负面作用”构成同义替换，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Half of the methane in the atmosphere is from animals."},{"option":2,"content":"Methane has become the chief source of greenhouse gas."},{"option":3,"content":"Consumer behavior may be influenced by the environment."},{"option":4,"content":"Meat consumption has an adverse effect on the environment."}]},{"id":102778,"title":"What do some nutritionists say about the strict vegetarian diet?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词However后面deficient in many of the necessary vitamins and minerals our bodies need“缺乏人体所需的维生素和矿物质”，与B选项lacks the vitamins and minerals essential for health构成同义替换，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It takes time for the human body to get used to it."},{"option":2,"content":"It lacks the vitamins and minerals essential for health."},{"option":3,"content":"It enhances immunity to certain diseases."},{"option":4,"content":"It helps people to live a much longer life."}]},{"id":102779,"title":"What does the speaker think more people need to do?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n文章结尾处become vegetarian“成为素食者”，与C选项Quit eating meats“放弃吃肉”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Produce green food."},{"option":2,"content":"Waste no food."},{"option":3,"content":"Quit eating meats."},{"option":4,"content":"Grow vegetable."}]}]},{"id":4771,"name":"2013.6 (Passage Three 卷一)","content":"    Alcoholism is a serious disease. Nearly nine million Americans alone suffer from the illness. Many scientists disagree about what the differences are between the alcohol addict and social drinker. The difference occurs when someone needs to drink. And this need gets in the way of his health or behavior. Alcohol causes a loss of judgment and alertness. After a long period, alcoholism can deteriorate the liver, the brain and other parts of the body. The illness is dangerous, because it is involved in half of all automobile accidents. [33]Another problem is that the victim often denies being an alcohol addict and won’t get help. Solutions do exist. Many hospitals and centers help patients cope. Without the assistance, the victim can destroy his life. He would detach himself from the routines of life. He may lose his employment, home or loved ones.\n    All the causes of the sickness are not discovered yet. There is no standard for a person with alcoholism. Victims range in age, race, sex and background. Some groups of people are more vulnerable to the illness. People from broken homes and North American Indians are two examples. People from broken homes often lack stable lives. [34]Indians likewise had the traditional life taken from them by white settlers who often encourage them to consume alcohol to prevent them from fighting back. The problem has now been passed on. Alcoholism is clearly present in society today. [35]People have started to get help and information. With proper assistance, victims can put their lives together one day.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20130601/20136(1)P3.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102780,"title":"What is the problem of the victims about alcoholism according to the speaker?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词Another后面denies being an alcohol addict“否认酒精上瘾”，与D选项do not admit being alcohol addicts“不承认酒精上瘾”构成同义替换，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They do not know any solution."},{"option":2,"content":"They do not give up drunk driving."},{"option":3,"content":"They do not behave in public places."},{"option":4,"content":"They do not admit being alcohol addicts."}]},{"id":102781,"title":"Why did white settlers introduce alcohol to Indians?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n原文中to prevent them from fighting back“以防止他们反抗”，与A选项To stop them from fighting back“以阻止他们反抗”构成同义替换，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"To stop them from fighting back.
