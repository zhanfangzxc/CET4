Scientists agree that key player in this scenario is the West Antarctic ice sheet, a Brazil-size mass of frozen water that is much as 7,000 feet thick. Unlike floating ice shelves which have little impact on sea level when they break up, the ice sheet anchored to bedrock will blow the sea surface. [27]Surrounded by open ocean, it is also vulnerable, but Antarctic experts disagree strongly on just how unstable it is. [28]Now, new evidence reveals that all or most of the West Antarctic ice sheet collapsed at least once during the past 1.3 million years, a period when global temperatures probably were not significantly higher than they are today. And the ice sheet was assumed to have been stable. In geological time, a million years is recent history. The proof, which was published last week in Science, comes from a team of scientists from Uppsala University in Sweden and California Institute of Technology who drew deep holes near the edge of ice sheet. Within samples collected from the solid substances lying beneath the ice. [29]They found fossils of microscopic marine plants which suggest that the region was once open ocean not solid ice. As Herman Engleheart, a co-author from the California Institute of Technology, says, “the West Antarctic ice sheet disappeared once and can disappear again.”","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/201012/201012P1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102713,"title":"What is one of the most frightening threats of global warming according to the passage?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词so … that后面coastal cities … will be flooded“海滨城市将被淹没”，与C选项Many coastal cities will be covered with water“许多海滨城市将被水覆盖”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The whole Antarctic region will be submerged."},{"option":2,"content":"Some polar animals will soon become extinct."},{"option":3,"content":"Many coastal cities will be covered with water."},{"option":4,"content":"The earth will experience extreme weathers."}]},{"id":102714,"title":"What did scientists disagree on?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词but和just后面How unstable“有多不稳定”，与B选项How unstable构成视听一致。专家对于冰层到底有多不稳定有极大的分歧，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"How humans are to cope with global warming."},{"option":2,"content":"How unstable the West Antarctic ice sheet is."},{"option":3,"content":"How vulnerable the coastal cities are."},{"option":4,"content":"How polar ice impacts global weather."}]},{"id":102715,"title":"What did the latest information reveal about the West Antarctic ice sheet?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词most后面collapsed at least once“至少有过一次崩塌”，与A选项collapsed at least once构成视听一致。新的证据显示，全部或者大部分的西部南极冰川在过去130万年里至少有过一次崩塌，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It collapsed at least once in the past 1.3 million years."},{"option":2,"content":"It sits firmly on solid rock at the bottom of the ocean."},{"option":3,"content":"It melted at temperatures a bit higher than those of today."},{"option":4,"content":"It will have little impact on sea level when it breaks up."}]},{"id":102716,"title":"What did the scientists’ latest findings suggest?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n文章结尾处the region was once open ocean“这里曾经是开阔的海洋”，与A选项the region was once open ocean构成视听一致，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The West Antarctic region was once an open ocean."},{"option":2,"content":"The West Antarctic ice sheet was about 7,000 feet thick."},{"option":3,"content":"The West Antarctic ice sheet was once floating ice."},{"option":4,"content":"The West Antarctic region used to be warmer than today."}]}]},{"id":4708,"name":"2010.12 Passage Two","content":"    It's always fun to write about research that you can actually try out for yourself.\n    Try this: Take a photo and upload it to Facebook, then after a day or so, note what the URL link to the picture is and then delete it. [30]Come back a month later and see  if the link works. Chances are, it will.\n    Facebook isn't alone here. Researchers at Cambridge University have found that nearly half of the social networking sites don't immediately delete pictures when a user requests they be removed. In general, photo-centric websites like Flickr were found to be better at quickly removing deleted photos upon request.\n    Why do \"deleted\" photos stick around so long? [31]The problem relates to the way data is stored on large websites: While your personal computer only keeps one copy of a file, large-scale services like Facebook rely on what are called content delivery networks to manage data and distribution. It's a complex system wherein data is copied to multiple intermediate devices, usually to speed up access to files when millions of people are trying to access the service at the same time. But because changes aren't reflected across the content delivery networks immediately, ghost copies of files tend to linger for days or weeks.\n    [32]In the case of Facebook, the company says data may hang around until the URL in question is reused, which is usually \"after a short period of time\", though obviously that time can vary considerably.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/201012/201012P2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102717,"title":"What does the speaker ask us to try out?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词if处if the link works“链接是否有效”，与B选项Whether a deleted photo is immediately removed from the web“删除了的照片是否立刻从网上被移除”构成同义替换，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Whether we can develop social ties on the Internet."},{"option":2,"content":"Whether a deleted photo is immediately removed from the web."},{"option":3,"content":"Whether our blogs can be renewed daily."},{"option":4,"content":"Whether we can set up our own websites."}]},{"id":102718,"title":"What accounts for the failure of some websites to remove photos immediately?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n原文中the way data is stored“数据储存方式”，与B选项The way they store data构成视听一致。文章说图片之所以不能立即删除跟它们存储的方式有关，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The number of visits they receive."},{"option":2,"content":"The way they store data."},{"option":3,"content":"The files they have collected."},{"option":4,"content":"The means they use to get information."}]},{"id":102719,"title":"When will the unwanted data eventually disappear from Facebook according to the company?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词until后面reused“再次使用”，与C选项reused,构成视听一致。以Facebook为例，只有URL被再次使用时才会被删除，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"When the system is down."},{"option":2,"content":"When new links are set up."},{"option":3,"content":"When the URL is reused."},{"option":4,"content":"When the server is restarted."}]}]},{"id":4711,"name":"2010.12 Passage Three","content":"    Enjoying an iced coffee? \n    [34]Better skip dinner or hit the gym afterwards, [33]with a cancer charity warning that some iced coffees contain as many calories as a hot dinner.\n    The World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) conducted a survey of iced coffees sold by some popular chains in Britain including Starbucks, Caffe Nero and Costa Coffee to gauge the calories as studies increasingly link obesity with cancer.\n    The worst offender--a coffee from Starbucks--had 561 calories.
