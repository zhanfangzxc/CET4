[26]And with stocks, currencies and companies all crashing, some are finding that taking the trip of a lifetime is actually a smart move right now. Prices are good, crowds are fewer and the dividends, like expanded worldview, lifelong memories, the satisfaction of boosting the global economy—can't be easily snatched away. Sylvia and Paul Custerson, a retired couple from Cambridge, England, recently took a 16-day vacation to Namibia, where they went on bird-watching excursions. Later this year, they are planning a trip to Patagonia. \"We're using our capital now,\" says Sylvia, \"And why not? We're not getting any interest in the bank. If it's a place we really want to go, then we will go. We may as well travel while we're fit and healthy. \"\n    Some travel agents are thriving in spite of the economy. \"We've had more people booking in the first quarter of this year than last,\" says Hubert Moineau, founder of Tselana Travel, [27]which is planning to introduce a new program of longer adventure trips, including polar expeditions and cruises in the Galápagos. \"We're hearing things like, “We don't know what the situation will be in six months so let's travel now\", Ashley Toft, managing director of the U. K. tour operator Explore, has been surprised to see an increase in last-minute bookings of high-priced trips to such places as India, Bhutan and Nepal. \"It seems people would rather give up something else than the big trip,\" he says. Travel has become a necessity. [28]It's just how we travel that is changing.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/201106/20116P1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102723,"title":"According to the speaker, why are some people willing to spend their money on travel these days?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n文章开头处taking the trip of a lifetime is actually a smart move“旅行不失为明智之举”，与B选项travel gives them their money's worth“花在旅行上的钱是很值得的”构成同义替换，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They think travel has become a trend."},{"option":2,"content":"They think travel gives them their money's worth."},{"option":3,"content":"They find many of the banks untrustworthy."},{"option":4,"content":"They lack the expertise to make capital investments."}]},{"id":102724,"title":"What is Tselana Travel planning to do, according to its founder?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n原文中a new program of longer adventure trips“新项目——长途探险旅程”，与D选项a new program of adventure trips构成视听一致。Tselana旅行社正在计划推行一项时间长途探险旅行的新项目，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Lower their prices to attract more customers."},{"option":2,"content":"Introduce travel packages for young travelers."},{"option":3,"content":"Design programs targeted at retired couples."},{"option":4,"content":"Launch a new program of adventure trips."}]},{"id":102725,"title":"According to Ashley Toft, managing director of Explore, what is changing now with regard to travels?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词It’s … that和just后面how we travel“我们以何种方式旅行”，与B选项The way people travel“人们的旅行方式”构成同义替换，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The role of travel agents."},{"option":2,"content":"The way people travel."},{"option":3,"content":"The number of last-minute bookings."},{"option":4,"content":"The prices of polar expeditions."}]}]},{"id":4717,"name":"2011.6 Passage Two","content":"    [29]Somehow the old male and female stereotypes no longer fit. Men and women in this country haven't been fulfilling their traditional roles for some time now. And there seem to be fewer and fewer differences between the sexes. For instance, even though more women than men are still homemakers without paying jobs, women have been taking over more responsibility in the business world, earning higher salaries than ever before and entering fields of work that used to be exclusively male areas. At office meetings and in group discussions, they might speak up more often, [30]express stronger opinions and come up with  more creative and practical ideas than their male colleagues. Several days ago, my 23-year-old daughter came to me with some important news. Not only had she found the highest paying job of her career, but she'd also accepted a date with the most charming men she'd ever met.“Really?” I responded, “tell me about them.” “Receptionist in an attorney's office and a welder at a construction site.” She answered in a matter-of-fact way. The interesting thing is my daughter's date is the receptionist and my daughter is the welder. The old stereotypes of men's and women's work have been changing more quickly than ever before, except perhaps in my own marriage. “Who's going to mow the lawn? ” I asked my husband this morning.“Oh, I will,” he answered politely. “That's men's work. ” “What?” Irritated, I raised my voice. “That's a ridiculous stereotype. [31]I'll show you who can do the best job on the lawn.” The work took 3 hours and I did it all myself.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/201106/20116P2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102726,"title":"What is the speaker mainly talking about?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n文章开头处Men and women …haven't been fulfilling traditional roles“男性和女性…不再扮演各自传统的角色”，与B选项The changing of roles played by men and women“男性和女性所扮演角色的变化”构成同义替换。本文主要探讨男性和女性角色的变化，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The old stereotypes about men and women."},{"option":2,"content":"The changing roles played by men and women."},{"option":3,"content":"The division of labor between men and women."},{"option":4,"content":"The widespread prejudice against women."}]},{"id":102727,"title":"What might women do at office meetings nowadays according to the speaker?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词more … than处more creative and practical ideas“更有创意和实际的想法”，与A选项more creative and practical ideas构成视听一致。Speaker说女性能提出更有创意、更实效的想法，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Offer more creative and practical ideas than men."},{"option":2,"content":"Ask questions that often lead to controversy."},{"option":3,"content":"Speak loudly enough to attract attention."},{"option":4,"content":"Raise issues on behalf of women."}]},{"id":102728,"title":"Why did the speaker mow the lawn herself that morning?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词best处show you who can do the best job on the lawn“向你证明谁修草坪修的最好”，与C选项show that women are capable of doing what men do“证明女人也能干男人干的话”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"To prove that she could earn her living as a gardener."},{"option":2,"content":"To show that women are more hardworking than men."},{"option":3,"content":"To show that women are capable of doing what men do."},{"option":4,"content":"To prove that she was really irritated with her husband."}]}]},{"id":4721,"name":"2011.6 Passage Three","content":"    Florence Hayes is a journalist for the Greenville Journal, the daily newspaper in town. [32]Specifically she covers crime in the Greenville area. This responsibility takes her to many different places every week—the police station, the court and the hospital. Most of the crimes that she writes about fall into two groups: violent crimes and crimes against property. [33]There isn't much violent crime in a small town like Greenville, or at least not as much as in the large urban areas. But assaults often occur on Friday and Saturday nights, near the bars downtown. There're also one or two rapes on campus every semester. Florence is very interested in this type of crime and tries to write a long article about each one. She expects that this will make women more careful when they walk around Greenville alone at night.\n    Fortunately, there were usually no murders in Greenville. [34]Crimes against property make up most of Miss Heyes' reporting. They range from minor cases of deliberate damaging of things to much more serious offenses, such as car accidents involving drunk drivers or bank robberies, but Florence has to report all of these violations from the thief who took typewriters from every unlock room in the dormitory to the thief who stole one million dollars worth of art work from the university museum. Miss Hayes enjoys working for a newspaper but she sometimes gets unhappy about all the crime she has to report. [35]She would prefer to start writing about something  more interesting and less unpleasant, such as local news or politics, maybe next year.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/201106/20116P3.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102729,"title":"What is Florence Hayes' main responsibility as a journalist?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词Specifically后面covers crime“负责报道犯罪情况”，与B选项Reporting criminal offenses“报道犯罪行为”构成同义替换，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Covering major events of the day in the city."},{"option":2,"content":"Reporting criminal offenses in Greenville."},{"option":3,"content":"Hunting news for the daily headlines."},{"option":4,"content":"Writing articles on family violence."}]},{"id":102730,"title":"What does the speaker say about security in Greenville?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词as much as处not as much as in the large urban areas“（犯罪行为）不如大城市里多”，与D选项fewer violent crimes than big cities“犯罪行为比大城市少”构成同义替换。Speaker说在Greenville这样的小镇，暴力犯罪并不多见，至少不如大城市里多，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is a much safer place than it used to be."},{"option":2,"content":"Rapes rarely occur in the downtown areas."},{"option":3,"content":"Assaults often happen on school campuses."},{"option":4,"content":"It has fewer violent crimes than big cities."}]},{"id":102731,"title":"What do we learn about crimes against property in the Greenville area?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词most处most of Miss Heyes' reporting“Miss Heyes报道的绝大部分”，与A选项a wide range of cases“案例数量很多”构成同义替换。在Greenville区域，侵犯财产犯罪数量很多，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"There are a wide range of cases."},{"option":2,"content":"They are very destructive."},{"option":3,"content":"There has been a rise in such crimes."},{"option":4,"content":"They have aroused fear among the residents."}]},{"id":102732,"title":"What would Florence Hayes prefer to do?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词more … less处more interesting and less unpleasant“更多有趣的和更少不愉快的”，与A选项pleasant“愉快的”构成同义替换，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Write about something pleasant."},{"option":2,"content":"Do some research on local politics."},{"option":3,"content":"Offer help to crime victims."},{"option":4,"content":"Work as a newspaper editor."}]}]}]}
