My answer is no. You can have a high IQ and a high EQ, which, of course is a winning combination, or be high in one and low in the other. [26]The best study was done at Bell Labs in New Jersey, a very high IQ place. They do research in development for the communications industry. In the division of electronics engineers, who were designing equipment so advanced that they work in teams of up to 150, co-workers and managers were asked to nominate the standouts. The stars are in priority and effectiveness. They came up with 10 or 15 names, and that group of stars was compared with everyone else. It turned out there was no difference in IQ, no difference in academic qualifications, no difference in years on the job. [27]The only difference was emotional intelligence. The stars were people who knew how to get along. He knew how to motivate themselves, usually the kind of people you like to hang out with. When these people run up against to a technical problem, to which they have to turn to someone else for an answer, they e-mail and get the answer right away, because they built up networks of people before they needed them. The other people would e-mail and wait up to two weeks for an answer. [28]So you can see, how being good in the interpersonal realm actually was a direct benefit, even for effectively pursuing a technical task.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20130602/20136(2)P1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102783,"title":"What does the speaker say about Bell Labs?

It is John Muir's own writing to bring readers a life story of this remarkable man who did so much to raise the American awareness of the environmental issue. As America's first environmentalist, John Muir lives his life forever dairying for undertaking new adventures. He spent most of his days outdoors and had deep love for the wild lands. In the book, we meet John Muir to use fearless climbing the roof of his house. He captures birds only to let them go when he realizes the cruelty involved. He becomes an inventor and sells his inventions in order to attend the university. As a young man, he began walking over tens of thousands miles during his lifetime, to the south of Florida, the west of California and north of Alaska, [30]where readers are taking a long and particularly hair-raising adventure on a large mass of floating ice. Muir's learning in observation throughout his life let him devote his last years to preserving the natural environment. [31]His writing and speaking raised awareness of the importance of conservation and helped bring about our national park system. Readers may feel they know John Muir after reading his story and may catch his passion for preserving the richness of our land. The other portrait of Muir's life has tested many for what means to be lifelong learners and to use that learning to inform and bring about change.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20130602/20136(2)P2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102786,"title":"What kind of book is the speaker introducing?

In fact, a virus emerged in the 1970s that could've been just that fatal. [32]Named after a river that passes through the Congo, the Ebola virus originally manifested itself in the interior of Africa in 1976. [33]Two strains of the disease of  almost identical symptoms affected humans—Ebola-Zaire and Ebola-Sudan. The Sudan version was deadly enough, killing 15% of those who were affected. However, Zaire with its 90% mortality rate was even worse. The origins, though not the cause of Ebola-Sudan can be traced back to a single individual in a Sudanese town. Ebola-Zaire seemed to interrupt in over 50 villages simultaneously. [34]Both strains quickly invaded local hospitals when needle sharing and other unhealthy practices ensured the rapid spreading of the infection by bringing people into contact with contaminated body fluids. If the virus had been capable of spreading through the air, or if one infected person had unknowingly entered a large population center, Ebola might have become a worldwide epidemic. However, soon after these fierce outbreaks, the virus died out, at least temporarily. Ebola was so deadly and killed so quickly that within a short period of time, there was no one around to infect. Hospital workers in at least one case deserted their workplace in panic, thus, halting administering of potentially unclean disease spreading injections, but Ebola has not disappeared. [35]With no known vaccination or cure available, it seems only a matter of time until another epidemic erupts.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20130602/20136(2)P3.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102789,"title":"What is Ebola virus named after?
