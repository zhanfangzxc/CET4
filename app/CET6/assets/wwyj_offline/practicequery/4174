We do issues of general social concern to our British audience. They can be anything from the future of the health service to the way the environment is going downhill.\nW: How do you choose the topic? [20]Do you choose one because it’s what the public wants to know about orbecause it’s what you feel the public ought to know about?\nM: I think it’s a mixture of both. Sometimes you have a strong feeling that something is important and you want to see it examined and you want to contribute to a public debate. Sometimes people come to you with things they are worried about and they can be quite small things. They can be a story about corruption in local government, something they can’t quite understand, why it doesn’t seem to be working out properly, like they are not having their litter collected properly, or the dustbins emptied.\nW: How do you know that you’ve got a really successful program? One that is just right for the time?\nM: [21]I think you get a sense about it after working in it in a number of years. You know which stories are going to get the attention.

[23]Instead, Harrogate has become a popular town for people to retire to. Its clean air, attractive parks, and the absence of any industry, make this an ideal spot for people looking for a quiet life. Now, to tell us more about Harrogate, I have with me Tom Percival, President of the Chamber of Commerce. Tom, one of the things visitor notices about Harrogate is the large area of open parkland right down into the middle of the town. Can you tell us more about it?\nM: Yes, certainly. The area is called the Stray.\nW: Why the Stray?\nM: It’s called that because in the old days, people let their cattle stray on the area, which was common land.\nW: Oh, I see.\nM: Then, with changes in farming and in land ownership, the Stray became part of the land owned by Harrogate.\nW: And is it protected?\nM: Oh, yes, indeed.

[23]You can prepare for a negotiation quite scientifically, but the execution of the negotiation has quite a lot to do with one’s artistic quality. The scientific part of a negotiation is in determining your strategy. What do you want out of it? What can you give? Then of course there are tactics. How do you go about it? Do you take an opening position in a negotiation which differs from the eventual goal you are heading for? And then of course there are the behavioral aspects.\nW: What do you mean by the behavioral aspects?\nM: Well, that’s I think where the art comes in. In your behavior, you can either be an actor.

Or you can be the honest type negotiator who’s known to his partners in negotiation and always plays everything straight.

[22]After last week's announcement that Phil Collins might give up touring because live concerts are ruining his voice, doctors are counseling stars about the dos and don'ts of voice care. Here in the studio today, we have Mr. Paul Phillips, an expert from the High Field Hospital. Paul, what advice would you give to singers facing voice problems?\nM: If pop singers have got voice problems, they really need to be more selective about where they work. They shouldn't work in smoky atmospheres. They also need to think about resting their voices after a show. Something else they need to be careful about is medicines. Aspirin, for example, singers should avoid aspirin. It thins the blood. [23]And if a singer coughs, this can result in the bruising of the vocal cords.\nW: And is it true that some singers use drugs before concerts to boost their voices when they have voice problems?\nM: Yes, this does happen on occasion. They are easily-available on the continent and they are useful if a singer has problems with his vocal cords and has to sing that night. But if they are taken regularly, they cause a thinning of the voice muscle. [24]Most pop singers suffer from three things: lack of training, overuse and abuse of the voice, especially when they are young. They have difficult lives. When they go on tour, they do a vast number of concerts, singing in smoky places.\nW: So, what would you advise the singers to do?\nM: Warm you voice up before a show and warm it down after.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20130601/20136(1)C2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102035,"title":"What does last week's announcement say about rock star, Phil Collins?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n女士说give up touring“放弃巡演”，与D选项give up concert tours构成视听一致。现场音乐会对嗓子造成了伤害，Phil Collins可能会放弃巡回演唱会，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He has been seeing doctors and counsellors."},{"option":2,"content":"He has found a new way to train his voice."},{"option":3,"content":"He was caught abusing drugs."},{"option":4,"content":"He might given up concert tours."}]},{"id":102036,"title":"What does Paul Philips say about aspirin?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n男士话中the bruising of the vocal cords“损伤声带”，与D选项do harm to singer’s vocal chords构成同义替换。Paul Philips说阿司匹林会对声带造成损害，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Singers may become addicted to it."},{"option":2,"content":"It helps singers warm themselves up."},{"option":3,"content":"Singers use it to stay away from colds."},{"option":4,"content":"It can do harm to singer’s vocal chords."}]},{"id":102037,"title":"What does Paul Philips say about young pop singers?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词Most后面lack of training“缺乏培训”，与B选项lack … training构成视听一致。Paul Philips说大多数流行歌手尤其是在他们年轻的时候缺乏培训，过度使用嗓子或用嗓方式不对，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They are eager to become famous."},{"option":2,"content":"Many lack professional training."},{"option":3,"content":"It can do harm to singers’ vocal chords."},{"option":4,"content":"They live a glamorous life."}]},{"id":102038,"title":"What are the speakers mainly talking about?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n文章开头处Rock stars … voice abuse“摇滚明星嗓音滥用的问题”，与C选项Voice problems among pop singers“流行歌手的嗓音问题”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Harm to singers done by smoky atmospheres."},{"option":2,"content":"Side effects of some common drugs."},{"option":3,"content":"Voice problems among pop singers."},{"option":4,"content":"Hardships experienced by many young singers."}]}]},{"id":4030,"name":"2013.6 (Conversation Two 卷二)","content":"M: [25]Kathy, chaos theory seems to be a branch of physics or mathematics. [23]You are an economist, so how does it influence your work?\nW: Well, in several ways. I'm responsible for financial development programmes in many parts of the world, so forecasting long range trends and making predictions on the basis of present evidence is what I do. [24]Chaos theory was developed by scientists trying to explain the movement of the planets and the changes in environmental conditions. Both of these things are also about making long term predictions on the basis of present evidence.\nM: Are many economists involved in this field?\nW: An increasing number. In the 1990s, many economists began to look at chaos theory as a way of providing models for forecasting.\nM: What kind of \"models\" are we talking about here?\nW: Well, that's a good question, because the basic idea of chaos theory is that there aren't any \"models\" as such—there aren't guaranteed forms, but rather patterns of change in development.\nM: Doesn't that mean that forecasting is impossible?\nW: No, but it certainly makes it more of a challenge. Mandelbrot, who did the experiment with stock exchange prices, for example, noted that although the outcomes were variable, there were in fact certain constancy. What we have to do is make sure we know what these are and take into account all the possible variables.\nM: But do economics and finance work in the same way as weather conditions or the movement of planets?\nW: Well, no, of course not.

I'm glad to continue the topic about music. [22]It is common knowledge that music can have a powerful effect on our emotions.

[23]Now psychologists are confirming that music can also help relieve depression and improve concentration.\nW: That's nice. Do they have any concrete examples?\nM: For instance, in a recent study, 15 surgeons were given some highly stressed math problems to solve.

[24]The doctors who got to choose their music experienced less stress and scored better than the others.\nW: That is surprising. How to explain this?\nM: One possible explanation is that listening to music you like stimulates the Alfa-wave in the brain, increases the heart rate and expands the breathing. That helps to reduce stress and sharpen concentration.\nW: Is there any other research?\nM: Yes. Other research suggests a second relation between the music and the brain: by examining the students' blood after listening to a variety of classical music collections, the researchers found that some students showed a large increase in a chemical substance, [25]a natural pain reliever, in their blood, which can help soothe the patient.\nW: Well, thank you so much for being with us today and having us know about another function of music.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20130603/20136(3)C2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102042,"title":"What is the talk mainly about?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n文章开头处powerful effect on our emotions“对人的情绪有强大的影响”，soothe patients …control pain“安慰病人和抑制疼痛”，与C选项benefits of music“音乐的好处”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Training given to music therapists."},{"option":2,"content":"How music prevents disease."},{"option":3,"content":"Studies on the benefits of music."},{"option":4,"content":"How musicians create music."}]},{"id":102043,"title":"According to the speaker, how is the music therapy currently used in medicine?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n男士话中relieve depression“缓解压抑”，与D选项relieve depression构成视听一致。男士说现在心理学家证实音乐可以帮助缓解压抑，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"In place of physical therapy."},{"option":2,"content":"To control brain problems."},{"option":3,"content":"To prevent heart disease."},{"option":4,"content":"To relieve depression."}]},{"id":102044,"title":"What effect did music have in the study of students exposed to classic music?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n男士话中a natural pain reliever“天然的疼痛缓解物质”，与D选项a natural painkiller“天然的止痛剂”构成同义替换。男士说在听了大量古典音乐的学生的血液内产生了一种可以减轻疼痛的天然化学物质，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It increased the students’ white blood cell."},{"option":2,"content":"It increased some students’ energy level."},{"option":3,"content":"It improved the students’ ability to play musical instruments."},{"option":4,"content":"It released a natural painkiller in some students’ bodies."}]},{"id":102045,"title":"What did the study done with surgeons show?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词better than处scored better than the others“比其他人得分高”，与B选项solved problems better“问题解决得更加出色”构成同义替换，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They like to have music in the operating room."},{"option":2,"content":"They solved problems better while listening to music they liked."},{"option":3,"content":"They preferred classical music."},{"option":4,"content":"They performed better when they used headphones."}]}]}]}
