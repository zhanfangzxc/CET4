But along with that excitement comes a new responsibility--understanding the need for common sense and maturity to avoid accidents. [26]In an effort to spread awareness to teens across the nation, the All-state Foundation sponsored a Keep-The-Drive Summit at Sunset Station on January 23rd.Students from Kennedy and Alamo heights high schools participated in the summit, which was held here for the first time. The goal of the year-long effort is to educate teens on the rules of safe driving and the sever consequence that can result if those rules are not followed, and then have them communicate that information to their peers. The students watched videos that told them about the numbers of teenager driving injuries and deaths. They listen to the videos as students from other cities share their stories of how their reckless driving affected not only their lives but also those of their passengers. “We are trying to create awareness in high schools across the countries,” said Westerman, an All-state representative. “We focus on changing how teens think behind the wheel.” [27]According to the presentation, more teens die in the automobile crashes in the United States each year than from drugs, violence, smoking and suicide. An average of 16 teens die every day in motor vehicle crashes and nearly forty percent of those are caused by speeding. Texas is the state with the most teen driving deaths according to the presentation. [28]Students agreed that the statistics were amazing and made them think twice about how they drive.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/200906/20096P1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102683,"title":"For what purpose did the All-state Foundation sponsor the Keep-The-drive Summit？ ","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词In an effort to后面spread awareness“传播意识”，与B选项alert teenagers to the dangers of reckless driving“警醒年轻人鲁莽驾驶的危险”构成同义替换，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"To help young people improve their driving skills."},{"option":2,"content":"To alert teenagers to the dangers of reckless driving."},{"option":3,"content":"To teach young people road manners through videotapes."},{"option":4,"content":"To show teens the penalties imposed on careless drivers."}]},{"id":102684,"title":"What causes the greatest number of deaths among American teens according to the presentation？","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词more后面automobile crashes“汽车事故”，与A选项Road accidents“公路事故”构成同义替换。短文中提到，与吸毒、暴力、吸烟和自杀相比，更多的美国少年死于汽车事故，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Road accidents."},{"option":2,"content":"Street violence."},{"option":3,"content":"Drug abuse."},{"option":4,"content":"Lung cancer."}]},{"id":102685,"title":"What can we conclude about the Keep-the-Drive Summit？","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n文章结尾处made them think twice about how they drive“使他们在驾车时三思而后行”，与C选项accomplished its objective“实现了预期的目标”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It has changed teens’ way of life."},{"option":2,"content":"It has made teens feel like adults."},{"option":3,"content":"It has accomplished its objective."},{"option":4,"content":"It has been supported by parents."}]}]},{"id":4677,"name":"2009.6 Passage Two","content":"    Dr. Allen Hersh designs smells for businesses. He says that it doesn't take a whole lot of smell to affect you. Store owners can lure you to the candy aisle, even if you don't realize you are smelling candy. This idea scares a lot of people. Groups that protect the rights of shoppers are upset. [29]They say the stores are using a kind of brainwashing which they call “smell-washing”. “It's pretty dishonest,” says Mark Silbergeld. He runs an organization that checks out products for consumers. The scientists hired to design the scents disagree. “There's soft background music. There's special lighting. There's all sort of bells being used,” says Dr. Hersh, [30]“Why not smells?” “One reason why not,” says Silbergeld, “is that some people are allergic to certain scents pumped into products or stores.” But there is a whole other side to this debate, “do the smells really work？”So far, there is little proof one way or the other. But Dr. Hersh has run some interesting experiments. In one of Hersh's experiments,31 volunteers were led into a shoe store that smells slightly like flowers. Later, another group shopped in the same store, but with no flower odor. [31]Dr. Hersh found that 84% of the shoppers were  more likely to buy the shoes in the shoes in the flower-scented room, but Hersh found out something even stranger. “Whether the volunteers like the flower scent or not didn't matter, ”Hersh says, “Some reported that they hated the smell, but they still were more likely to buy the shoes in the scented room.”","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/200906/20096P2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102686,"title":"Why are some people against the use of smells to attract customers？","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n原文中brainwashing“洗脑”，与B选项misled by the smells“被味道误导”构成同义替换。反对者称顾客会被味道所误导，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Customers may get addicted to the smells."},{"option":2,"content":"Customers may be misled by the smells."},{"option":3,"content":"It hides the defects of certain goods."},{"option":4,"content":"It gives rise to unfair competition."}]},{"id":102687,"title":"What is Dr. Hersh's attitude to the use of smells for business？","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n原文中Why not smells?“为什么不能使用味道？”，与C选项Supportive“赞成的”构成同义替换。Dr. Hersh说可以用其他感官刺激来吸引顾客，为什么不能使用味道，可见他是赞成使用味道的，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Flexible."},{"option":2,"content":"Critical."},{"option":3,"content":"Supportive."},{"option":4,"content":"Cautious."}]},{"id":102688,"title":"What did Hersh's experiment show？","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词more后面likely to buy the shoes in the shoes in the flower-scented room“愿意在有花香的商店里买鞋”，与A选项stimulated people’s desire to buy“刺激了人们的购买欲望”构成同义替换，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The flower scent stimulated people’s desire to buy."},{"option":2,"content":"Stronger smells had greater effects on consumers."},{"option":3,"content":"Most shoppers hated the smalls in the shoe store."},{"option":4,"content":"84% of the customers were unaware of the smells."}]}]},{"id":4681,"name":"2009.6 Passage Three","content":"    This is Ray MacArthur with the news. Reports are coming in of a major train crash in Japan. [32]A passenger train carrying hundreds of workers home from the center of Tokyo is reported to have hit an oncoming goods train. Both were traveling at high speed. [33]Figures are not yet available but it is believed that the death toll could be as high as 300, with hundreds more injured. Emergency and Rescue Services rushed to the scene. But our reporter says it will take days to clear the track and to establish the numbers of the dead and injured. There was a similar accident on the same stretch of track four years ago.\n    [34]There was another bomb scare in a large London store last night during late night shopping. Following a telephone call to the police from an anonymous caller, hundreds of shoppers were shepherded out of the store while roads in the area were sealed off. Police dogs spent hours searching the store for a bag which the caller claimed contained 50 pounds of explosives. Nothing was found and the store was given the all-clear by opening time this morning. A police spokesman said that this was the third bomb scare within a week and that we should all be on our guard.\n    And finally, the motoring organizations have issued a warning to drivers following the recent falls of snow in many parts of the country.
