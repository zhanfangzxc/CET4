Kapur points out that while the model adopted by many teachers when introducing students to new knowledge—providing lots of structure and guidance early on ,until the students show that they can do it on their own—makes intuitive sense, it may not be the best way to promote learning. Rather, it’s better to let the learners wrestle(较劲) with the material on their own for a while, refraining from giving them any assistance at the start. In a paper published recently, kapur applied the principle of productive failure to mathematical problem solving in three schools.\n    With one group of students, the teacher provided strong “scaffolding”—instructional support—and feedback. With the teacher’s help, these pupils were able to find the answers to their set of problems. Meanwhile, a second group was directed to solve the same problems by collaborating with one another, without any prompts from their instructor. These students weren’t able to complete with one another, correctly. But in the course of trying to do so ,they generated a lot of ideas about the nature of the problems and about what potential solutions would look like. And when the two groups were tested on what they’d learned the second group “significantly outperformed” the first.\n    The apparent struggles of the floundering(挣扎的) group have what Kapur calls a “hidden efficacy” : they lead people to understand the deep structure of problems, not simply their correct solutions. When these students encounter a new problem of the same type on a test, they’re able to transfer the knowledge they’re gathered more effectively than those who were the passive recipients of someone else’s expertise.\n    In the real world, problems rarely come neatly packaged, so being able to discern their deep structure is key. But, kapur notes, none of us like to fail, no matter how often Silicon Valley entrepreneurs praise the beneficial effects of an idea that fails or a start-up company that crashes and burns. So we need to “design for productive failure” by building it into the learning process. Kapur has identified three conditions that promote this kind of beneficial struggle. First, choose problems to work on that”challenge but do not frustrate.” Second, provide learners with opportunities to explain and elaborate on what they’re going. Third, give learners the chance to compare and contrast good and bad solutions to the problems. And to those students who protest this tough-love teaching-style: you’ll thank me later.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103359,"title":"Why does the author call the learning process a paradox?

He planted soybean(大豆) sold as cattle feed. But Monsanto, the agricultural giant, insists it has a patent on the kind of genetically modified seeds Bowman used — and that the patent continues to all of the progeny(后代) of those seeds.\n    Have we really gotten to the point that planting a seed can lead to a high-stakes Supreme Court patent lawsuit? We have, and that case is Bowman v. Monsanto, which is being argued on Tuesday. Monsanto’s critics have attacked the company for its “merciless legal battles against small farmers,” and they are hoping this will be the case that puts it in its place. They are also hoping the court’s ruling will rein in patent law, which is increasingly being used to claim new life forms as private property.\n    Monsanto and its supporters, not surprisingly, see the case very differently. They argue that when a company like Monsanto goes to great expense to create a valuable new genetically modified seed, it must be able to protect its property interests. If farmers like Bowman are able to use these seeds without paying the designated fee, it will remove the incentives for companies like Monsanto to innovate.\n    The central issue in the case is whether patent rights to living things extend to the progeny of those things. Monsanto argues that its patents extend to later generations. But Bowman’s supporters argue that Monsanto is trying to expand the scope of patents in ways that would enrich big corporations and hurt small farmers. They say that if Monsanto wins, the impact will extend far beyond agriculture — locking up property rights in an array of important areas. Knowledge Ecology International contends that the Supreme Court’s ruling could have “profound effects” on other biotech industries.\n    If this were a Hollywood movie, the courageous old Indiana farmer would beat the profit-minded corporation before the credits rolled. But this is a real-life argument before a Supreme Court that has a well-earned reputation for looking out for the interests of large corporations. This case gives the court an opportunity to rein in the growing use of patents to protect genetically engineered crops and other life forms — but the court may well use it to give this trend a powerful new endorsement.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103364,"title":"Why did Vernon Bowman get sued?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中的Vernon Bowman,和sued定位至首段。\n解析：首段第一句说，Vernon Bowman, a 75-year-old farmer from rural Indiana, did something that got him sued. “75岁的印第安纳州农场主Vernon Bowman，由于一些事情而遭到起诉”；本段后面介绍这个事件，He planted soybean(大豆) sold as cattle feed，But Monsanto, the agricultural giant, insists it has a patent on the kind of genetically modified seeds Bowman used — and that the patent continues to all of the progeny(后代) of those seeds，他种植的大豆作为牛的饲料出售，但是农业巨头孟山都公司坚持拥有鲍曼所使用的转基因种子的专利——而且，该专利对种子的后代也有效”。可见Vernon Bowman因为没有支付专利费就种植大豆而遭到起诉，即B为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He used genetically modified seeds to feed his cattle."},{"option":2,"content":"He planted soybeans without paying for the payment."},{"option":3,"content":"He made a profit out of Monsanto’s commercial secrets."},{"option":4,"content":"He obtained Monsanto’s patented seeds by illegal means."}]},{"id":103365,"title":"What are Monsanto’s critics hoping the Supreme Court will do?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中的Monsanto’s critics、hoping、Supreme Court定位至第二段第四句。\n解析：定位句说，They are also hoping the court’s ruling will rein in patent law, which is increasingly being used to claim new life forms as private property，“孟山都的批评者们希望法院的裁决能规范专利法，因为越来越多新生命形式被注册为私有财产”。可见，孟山都的批评者们希望高等法院否决孟山都公司延伸专利权的做法，即C为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Allow small farmers to grow genetically modified soybeans."},{"option":2,"content":"Punish Monsanto for infringing on small farmers’’ interests."},{"option":3,"content":"Rule against Monsanto’s excessive extension of its patent rights."},{"option":4,"content":"Abolish the patent law concerning genetically engineered seeds."}]},{"id":103366,"title":"What is the argument of Monsanto and its supporters?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中的Monsanto and its supporters、argument定位至第三段第一、三句。\n解析：第三段第一句说，Monsanto and its supporters, not surprisingly, see the case very differently，“毫不奇怪，孟山都和它的支持者认为对此持不同观点”；If farmers like Bowman are able to use these seeds without paying the designated fee, it will remove the incentives for companies like Monsanto to innovate，“如果像Bowman这样的农民无需支付指定的费用就能使用这些种子，那么像孟山都这样的公司将失去创新的动力”。可见，孟山都和其支持者争论的焦点是要不要保护种子专利权以鼓励创新，即A为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Patent rights should be protected to encourage innovation."},{"option":2,"content":"Bowman cannot plant the seeds without Monsanto’s consent."},{"option":3,"content":"Monsanto has the right to recover the costs of its patented seeds."},{"option":4,"content":"Patent law on genetically modified seeds should not be challenged."}]},{"id":103367,"title":"What is the key issue in the Bowman vs. Monsanto case?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中的key issue定位至第五段第一句。\n解析：定位句说，The central issue in the case is whether patent rights to living things extend to the progeny of those things，“该案件的核心问题是对生物的专利权能否延伸到他们的后代”。即Bowman与孟山都案的核心问题是生物专利权能否延伸到他们的后代，即D为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Whether patent for seeds is harmful to agricultural production."},{"option":2,"content":"Whether the biotech industry should take priority over agriculture."},{"option":3,"content":"Whether measures should be introduced to protect small farmers."},{"option":4,"content":"Whether patent for living things applies to their later generations."}]},{"id":103368,"title":"What do we learn from the last paragraph?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中的last paragraph定位至最后一段。\n解析：最后一段第一句说，If this were a Hollywood movie, the courageous old Indiana farmer would beat the profit-minded corporation before the credits rolled，“如果这是一部好莱坞电影，在电影的最后一刻，勇敢的印第安老农会打败唯利是图的企业”。可见，只有在好莱坞电影中，Bowman才有可能打赢官司，即D为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Hollywood movies usually have an unexpected, dramatic impact on real-life arguments."},{"option":2,"content":"The Supreme Court will try to change its reputation for supporting large corporations."},{"option":3,"content":"The Supreme Court is likely to persuade the parties concerned to work out a settlement."},{"option":4,"content":"The ruling would be in Bowman’s favor if the case were argued in a Hollywood movie."}]}]}]}
