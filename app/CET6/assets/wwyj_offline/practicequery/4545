We might as well do that now, don’t you think?\nM: Sure, let’s see. First we saw Frank Brisenski. What did you think of him?\nW: Well, he’s certainly a very polite young man.\nM: And very relaxed, too.\nW: But his appearance…\nM: Um... He wasn’t well dressed. He wasn’t even wearing a tie.\nW: But he did have a nice voice. He'd sound good on the telephone.\nM: True. And I thought he seemed very intelligent. He answered Dona’s questions very well.\nW: That’s true, but dressing well is important. Well, let’s think about the others. Now what about Barbara Jones? She had a nice voice, too. She'd sound good on the telephone, and she was well dressed, too.\nM: Um... She did look very neat, very nicely dressed, but…\nW: But so shy. She wouldn’t be very good at talking to people at the front desk.\nM: Um...OK. Now who was the next? Ah...Yes, David Wallace. I thought he was very good, had a lot of potential. What do you think?\nW: Um...He seemed like a very bright guy. He dressed very nicely, too. And he had a really nice appearance.\nM: He seemed relaxed to me, the type of person people feel comfortable with right away.\nW: He was polite, but also very friendly and relaxed as you say. I think he’ll be good with the guests at the front desk.\nM: He had a very pleasant voice, too.\nW: That’s right. OK, good! I guess we have our receptionist then, don’t you?\nM: Yes, I think so.

Is that the reference library?\nW: Yes. Can I help you?\nM: I hope so. I rang earlier and asked for some information about Dennis Hutton, the scientist. You asked me to ring back.\nW: Oh, yes. I have found something.\nM: Good. I’ve got a pencil and paper. Perhaps you could read out what it says.\nW: Certainly. Hutton Dennis, born—Darlington, 1836； died—New York, 1920.\nM: Yes, got that.\nW: Inventor and physicist, the son of a farm worker. He was admitted to the University of London at the age of 15.\nM: Yes.\nW: He graduated at 17 with the first class degree in physics and mathematics. All right?\nM: Yes, all right.\nW: He made his first notable achievement at the age of 18. It was a method of refrigeration which rose from his work in low temperature physics. He became a professor of Mathematics at the University of Manchester at 24 where he remained for twelve years. During that time, he married one of his students, Natasha Willoughby.\nM: Yes, go on.\nW: Later working together in London, they laid the foundations of modern physics by showing that normal laws of cause and effect do not apply at the level of subatomic particles. For this he and his wife received the Nobel Prize for physics in 1910, and did so again in 1912 for their work on very high frequency radio waves. In his lifetime, Hutton patented 244 inventions. Do you want any more?\nM: Yes. When did he go to America?\nW: Let me see. In 1920 he went to teach in New York and died there suddenly after only three weeks. Still he was a good age.\nM: Yes, I suppose so.
