China? India? Brazil? How about trade?\n    When the Commerce Department reported last week that the trade deficit in June approached $50 billion, it set off a new round of economic doomsaying. Imports, which soared to $200.3 billion in the month, are subtracted in the calculation of gross domestic product. The larger the trade deficit, the smaller the GDP. Should such imbalances continue, pessimists say, they could contribute to slower growth.\n    But there's another way of looking at the trade data. Over the past two years, the figures on imports and exports seem not to signal a double-dip recession – a renewed decline in the broad level of economic activity in the United States – but an economic expansion.\n    The rising volume of trade – more goods and services shuttling in and out of the United States – is good news for many sectors. Companies engaged in shipping, trucking, rail freight, delivery, and logistics (物流) have all been reporting better than expected results. The rising numbers signify growing vitality in foreign markets – when we import more stuff, it puts more cash in the hands of people around the world, and U.S. exports are rising because more foreigners have the ability to buy the things we produce and market. The rising tide of trade is also good news for people who work in trade-sensitive businesses, especially those that produce commodities for which global demand sets the price – agricultural goods, mining, metals, oil.\n    And while exports always seem to lag, U.S. companies are becoming more involved in the global economy with each passing month. General Motors sells as many cars in China as in America each month. While that may not do much for imports, it does help GM's balance sheet – and hence makes the jobs of U.S.-based executives more stable.\n    One great challenge for the U.S. economy is slack domestic consumer demand. Americans are paying down debt, saving more, and spending more carefully. That's to be expected, given what we've been through. But there's a bigger challenge. Can U.S.-based businesses, large and small, figure out how to get a piece of growing global demand? Unless you want to pick up and move to India, or Brazil, or China, the best way to do that is through trade. It may seem obvious, but it's no longer enough simply to do business with our friends and neighbors here at home.\n    Companies and individuals who don't have a strategy to export more, or to get more involved in foreign markets, or to play a role in global trade, are shutting themselves out of the lion's share of economic opportunity in our world.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103110,"title":"How do pessimists interpret the U.S. trade deficit in June?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的pessimists定位到原文第二段最后一句。\n解析：定位句说Should such imbalances continue, pessimists say, they could contribute to slower growth，“悲观主义者说，如果不平衡持续下去，就会导致增涨变缓”。即悲观主义者认为美国的贸易逆差会导致经济放缓，故正确选项为C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is the result of America's growing focus on domestic market."},{"option":2,"content":"It signifies a change in American economic structure."},{"option":3,"content":"It could lead to slower growth of the national economy."},{"option":4,"content":"It reflects Americans' preference for imported goods."}]},{"id":103111,"title":"What does the author say about the trade data of the past two years?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的trade data of the past two years定位到第三段第一句和第二句。\n解析：定位句But there's another way of looking at the trade data.

We should take this concern seriously as universities are key in the national innovation system.\n    However, we do have to challenge the unthinking complaint that the sector does not do enough in taking ideas to market. The most recent comparative data on the performance of universities and research institutions in Australia, Canada, USA and UK shows that, from a relatively weak starting position, the UK now leads on many indicators of commercialisation activity.\n    When viewed at the national level, the policy interventions of the past decade have helped transform the performance of UK universities. Evidence suggests the UK's position is much stronger than in the recent past and is still showing improvement. But national data masks the very large variation in the performance of individual universities. The evidence shows that a large number of universities have fallen off the back of the pack, a few perform strongly and the rest chase the leaders.\n    This type of uneven distribution is not peculiar to the UK and is mirrored across other economies. In the UK, research is concentrated: less than 25% of universities receive 75% of the research funding. These same universities are also the institutions producing the greatest share of PhD graduates, science citations, patents and license income. The effect of policies generating long-term resource concentration has also created a distinctive set of universities which are research-led and commercially active. It seems clear that the concentration of research and commercialization work creates differences between universities.\n    The core objective for universities which are research-led must be to maximise the impact of their research efforts. These universities should be generating the widest range of social, economic and environmental benefits. In return for the scale of investment, they should share their expertise in order to build greater confidence in the sector.\n    Part of the economic recovery of the UK will be driven by the next generation of research commercialization spilling out of our universities. There are three dozen universities in the UK which are actively engaged in advanced research training and commercialization work.\n    If there was a greater coordination of technology transfer offices within regions and a simultaneous investment in the scale and functions of our graduate schools, universities could, and should, play a key role in positioning the UK for the next growth cycle.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103115,"title":"What does the author think of UK universities in terms of commercialization?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的UK universities 和 commercialisation 定位至第三段第二句。\n解析：定位句中the UK now leads on many indicators of commercialisation activity，“英国在许多商业活动指标上都出于领先地位”。即英国的大学在（知识）商业化方面仍处于领先集团，即D选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They have lost their leading position in many ways."},{"option":2,"content":"They do not regard it as their responsibility."},{"option":3,"content":"They fail to convert knowledge into money."},{"option":4,"content":"They still have a place among the world leaders."}]},{"id":103116,"title":"What does the author say about the national data on UK universities' performance in commercialization?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的UK universities' performance定位至第四段第一句。\n解析：第四段第一句说过去十年的政策干预对英国大学的表现产生了积极地影响。第三句出现关键转折，But national data masks the very large variation in the performance of individual universities，“但是全国性的数据掩盖了单个大学之间的巨大差异”，即没有反应出单个大学的不同表现，故A选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It does not reflect the differences among universities."},{"option":2,"content":"It masks the fatal weaknesses of government policy."},{"option":3,"content":"It does not rank UK universities in a scientific way."},{"option":4,"content":"It indicates their ineffective use of government resources."}]},{"id":103117,"title":"We can infer from Paragraph 5 that \"policy interventions\" (Line 1, Para. 4) refers to _____.","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的Paragraph 5和policy interventions定位到第五段的第二句。\n解析：定位句说，In the UK, research is concentrated: less than 25% of universities receive 75% of the research funding，“英国存在着研究集中化的情况，即不到25%的大学获得了75%的研究经费”，即资源集中在少数学校上，故C选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"fair distribution of funding for universities and research institutions"},{"option":2,"content":"compulsory cooperation between universities and industries"},{"option":3,"content":"concentration of resources in a limited number of universities"},{"option":4,"content":"government aid to non-research-oriented universities"}]},{"id":103118,"title":"What does the author suggest research-led universities do?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的research-led university定位至第六段第一、二句。\n解析：第六段第一句，The core objective for universities which are research-led must be to maximise the impact of their research efforts，“研究主导型大学必须以其研究成果影响最大化作为其核心目标”。第二句说These universities should be generating the widest range of social, economic and environmental benefits，“这些大学应该生产出最广泛的社会、经济和环境利益”。即作者认为研究型主导大学应该使其所作研究效益最大化，故B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Generously share their facilities with those short of funds."},{"option":2,"content":"Fully utilise their research to benefit all sectors of society."},{"option":3,"content":"Spread their influence among top research institutions."},{"option":4,"content":"Publicise their research to win international recognition."}]},{"id":103119,"title":"How can the university sector play a key role in the UK's economic growth?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的play a key role 定位至最后一段。\n解析：最后一段说，If there was a greater coordination of technology transfer offices within regions and a simultaneous investment in the scale and functions of our graduate schools, universities could, and should, play a key role in positioning the UK for the next growth cycle，“如果地区间的技术转移部门的协调更加顺畅，并同时对研究生院进行投入使其规模和功能增强，大学就会在下一轮经济增长中发挥重要作用”，即英国的经济增长需要技术部门的协调和对研究生院校进行投入，故C选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"By increasing the efficiency of technology transfer agencies."},{"option":2,"content":"By establishing more regional technology transfer offices."},{"option":3,"content":"By promoting technology transfer and graduate school education."},{"option":4,"content":"By asking the government to invest in technology transfer research."}]}]}]}
