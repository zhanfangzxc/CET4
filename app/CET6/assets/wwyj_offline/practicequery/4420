What distinguishes a depression from a harsh is paralyzing fear—fear of the unknown so great that it causes consumers, business, and investors to retreat and panic. They save up cash and desperately cut spending. They sell stocks and other assets. A shattering loss of confidence inspires behavior that overwhelms the normal self-correcting mechanisms that usually prevent a recession from becoming deep and prolonged: a depression.\n    Comparing 1929 with 2007-09, Christina Romer, the head of President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, finds the initial blow to confidence far greater now than then. True, stock prices fell a third from September to December 1929, but fewer American then owned stocks. Moreover, home prices barely dropped. From December 1928 to December 1929, total household wealth declined only 3%. By contrast, the loss in household wealth between December 2007 and December 2008 was 17%. Both stocks and homes, more widely held, dropped more. Thus traumatized(受到创伤), the economy might have gone into a free fall ending in depression. Indeed, it did go into free fall. Shoppers refrained from buying cars, appliances, and other big-ticket items. Spending on such “durables” dropped at a 12% annual rate in 2008’s third quarter, a 20% rate in the fourth. And businesses shelved investment projects.\n    That these huge declines didn’t lead to depression mainly reflects, as Romer argues, countermeasures taken by the government. Private markets for goods, services, labor, and securities do mostly self-correct, but panic feeds on itself and disarms these stabilizing tendencies. In this situation, only government can protect the economy as a whole, because most individuals and companied are involved in the self-defeating behavior of self-protection.\n    Government’s failure to perform this role in the early 1930s transformed recession into depression. Scholars will debate which interventions this time—the Federal Reserve’s support of a failing credit system, guarantees of bank debt, Obama’s “stimulus” plan and bank “stress test”—counted most in preventing a recurrence. Regardless, all these complex measures had the same psychological purpose: to reassure people that the free fall would stop and, thereby, curb the fear that would perpetuate(使持久) a free fall.\n    All this improved confidence. But the consumer sentiment index remains weak, and all the rebound has occurred in American’ evaluation of future economic conditions, not the present. Unemployment(9.8%) is abysmal(糟透的), the recovery’s strength unclear. Here, too, there is an echo from the 1930s. Despite bottoming out in 1933, the Depression didn’t end until Word War Ⅱ. Some government policies aided recovery; some hindered it. The good news today is that the bad news is not worse.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103160,"title":"Why do consumers, businesses and investors retreat and panic in times of depression?","textExplain":"定位：由题干的consumers，business，investors retreat和panic等词定位到第一段第二句。\n解析：定位句说，fear of the unknown so great that it causes consumers, business, and investors to retreat and panic，“（经济萧条带来的）对未知的恐惧如此之大，以至于消费者、商人和投资者感到恐慌并且退缩”，可知对未知的恐惧是人们在经济萧条中退缩和恐慌的原因，即D选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They suffer great losses in stocks, property and other assets."},{"option":2,"content":"They find the self-correcting mechanisms dysfunctioning."},{"option":3,"content":"They are afraid the normal social order will be paralyzed."},{"option":4,"content":"They don’t know what is going to happen in the future."}]},{"id":103161,"title":"What does Christina Romer say about the current economic recession?","textExplain":"定位：由题干的Christina Romer定位到第二段第一句。\n解析：定位句说，Comparing 1929 with 2007-09,Christina Romer, the head of President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, finds the initial blow to confidence far greater now than then，“奥巴马总统的经济顾问委员会主席Christina Romer将通过1929年的经济大萧条和2007-2009年间的经济衰退进行对比，发现后者在初期对人们信心的打击大大超过前者”。即此次经济萧条对信心的打击超过了1929的经济大萧条，故B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Its severity is no match for the Great Depression of 1929."},{"option":2,"content":"Its initial blow to confidence far exceeded that of 1929."},{"option":3,"content":"It has affected house owners more than stock holders."},{"option":4,"content":"It has resulted in a free fall of the prices of commodities."}]},{"id":103162,"title":"Why didn’t the current recession turn into a depression according to Christina Romer?","textExplain":"定位：由题干的current recession，depression和Christina Romer定位到第三段第一句。\n解析：定位句说，That these huge declines didn’t lead to depression mainly reflects, as Romer argues, countermeasures taken by the government，“Romer指出，2007年严重的经济衰退并没有引发经济萧条，这个事实表明政府采取了应对措施”。由此可见，政府采取的政策行之有效，避免了再次出现经济大萧条，故A选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The government intervened effectively."},{"option":2,"content":"Private markets corrected themselves."},{"option":3,"content":"People refrained from buying durables and big-ticket items."},{"option":4,"content":"Individuals and companies adopted self-protection measures."}]},{"id":103163,"title":"What is the chief purpose of all the countermeasures taken?","textExplain":"定位：由题干的purpose，countermeasures定位到第四段最后一句。\n解析：定位句说，Regardless, all these complex measures had the same psychological purpose: to reassure people that the free fall would stop and, thereby, curb the fear that would perpetuate(使持久) a free fall，“政府所采取的措施都有一个共同的心理上的目的：消除人们对经济自由下跌的顾虑，从而遏制有可能会导致经济持久自由下跌的恐慌心里”，故B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"To create job opportunities."},{"option":2,"content":"To curb the fear of a lasting free fall."},{"option":3,"content":"To stimulate domestic consumption."},{"option":4,"content":"To rebuild the credit system."}]},{"id":103164,"title":"What does the author think of today’s economic situation?","textExplain":"定位：由题干的today定位到文章最后一句。\n解析：定位句说，The good news today is that the bad news is not worse，“好消息是糟糕的情况没有恶化”，即C选项It has not gone from bad to worse为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It may worsen without further stimulation."},{"option":2,"content":"It will see a rebound sooner or later."},{"option":3,"content":"It has not gone from bad to worse."},{"option":4,"content":"It does not give people reason for pessimism."}]}]},{"id":5131,"name":"2013.6 (Passage Two 卷二)","content":"    “Usually when we walk through the rain forest we hear a soft sound from all the moist leaves and organic debris on the forest floor,” says ecologist Daniel Nepstad. “Now we increasingly get rustle and crunch. That’s the sound of a dying forest.”\n    Predictions of the collapse of the tropical rain forests have been around for years. Yet until recently the worst forecasts were almost exclusively linked to direct human activity, such as clear-cutting and burning for pastures or farms. Left alone, it was assumed, the excess carbon dioxide and other planet-warming greenhouse gases. Now it turns out that may be wishful thinking. Some scientists believe that the rise in carbon levels means that the Amzon and other rain forests in Asia and Africa may go from being assets in the battle against rising temperatures to liabilities. Amazon plants, for instance, hold more than 100 billion metric tons of carbon, equal to 15 years of tailpipe and chimney emissions. If the collapse of the rain forests speeds up dramatically, it could eventually release 3.5-5 billion metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere each year-making forests the leading source of greenhouse gases.\n    Uncommonly severe droughts brough on by global climate changes have led to forest-eating wildfires from Australia to Indonesia, but nowhere more acutely than in the Amazon. Some experts say that the rain forest is already at the brink of collapse.\n    Extreme weather and reckless development are plotting against the rain forest in ways that scientists have never seen. Trees need more water as temperatures rise, but the prolonged droughts have robbed them of moisture, making whole forests easily cleared of trees and turned into farmland. The picture worsens with each round of EL Niño, the unusually warm currents in the rain forest. Runaway fires pour even more carbon into the air, which increases temperatures, starting the whole vicious cycle all over again.\n    More than paradise lost, a perishing rain forest could trigger a domino effect—sending winds and rains kilometers off course and loading the skies with even greater levels of greenhouse gases—that will be left far beyond the Amazon, fires deliberately set by frontier settlers and developers hurl up almost half a billion metric tons of carbon a year, placing Brazil among the top five contributors to greenhouse gases in the world.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103165,"title":"We learn from the first paragraph that __________.","textExplain":"定位：由题干提示定位到第一段。\n解析：该段引用了生态学家Daniel Nepstad的话，通常在穿越热带雨林时，潮湿的树林和地上枯萎的有机物碎屑发出的声音是轻柔的，但是现在人们大多听到的是瑟瑟声和嘎吱嘎吱的响声，这是森林垂死挣扎的声音。即声音可以反映出雨林的健康状况，故D选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"dead leaves and tree debris make the same sound"},{"option":2,"content":"trees that are dying usually give out a soft moan"},{"option":3,"content":"organic debris echoes the sounds in a rain forest"},{"option":4,"content":"the sound of a forest signifies its health condition"}]},{"id":103166,"title":"In the second paragraph, the author challenges the view that __________.","textExplain":"定位：由题干的the second paragraph定位到第二段。\n解析：第二段第二句说，Yet until recently the worst forecasts were almost exclusively linked to direct human activity，“最糟糕的（关于热带雨林消亡的）预言几乎全部与人类直接行为联系在一起”，即人类活动导致雨林被破坏，故A选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"the collapse of rain forests is caused by direct human interference"},{"option":2,"content":"carbon emissions are the leading cause of current global warning"},{"option":3,"content":"the condition of rain forests has been rapidly deteriorating"},{"option":4,"content":"rain forests should not be converted into pastures or farm"}]},{"id":103167,"title":"The author argues that the rising carbon levels in rain forests may __________.","textExplain":"定位：由题干的rising carbon levels in rain forest定位到第二段后半部分。\n解析：第二段最后一句话说，If the collapse of the rain forests speeds up dramatically, it could eventually release 3.5-5 billion metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere each year-making forests the leading source of greenhouse gases，“如果雨林瓦解的速度急剧加快，最终可能会导致每年有35-50亿公吨碳释放到大气中，这会使森林成为温室气体的主要来源”，可见雨林中的碳排放量急剧增加，会使雨林成为主要的温室气体来源。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"turn them into a major source of greenhouse gases"},{"option":2,"content":"change the weather patterns throughout the world"},{"option":3,"content":"pose a threat to wildlife"},{"option":4,"content":"accelerate their collapse"}]},{"id":103168,"title":"What has made it easier to turn some rain forests into farmland?","textExplain":"定位：由题干的easier和turn rain forests into farmland定位到第四段第二句。\n解析：定位句说，Trees need more water as temperatures rise, but the prolonged droughts have robbed them of moisture, making whole forests easily cleared of trees and turned into farmland，“随着温度上升，树木需要更多的水，但是长期干旱会使树木缺乏水分，在这种恶劣的情况下，树木很容易干枯，整个森林也随着消亡，成为农田”。可见雨林变为农田的原因是缺少降雨。故C选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Rapid rise in carbon levels."},{"option":2,"content":"Reckless land development."},{"option":3,"content":"Lack of rainfall resulting from global warming."},{"option":4,"content":"The unusual warm currents in the Pacific Ocean."}]},{"id":103169,"title":"What makes Brazil one of the world’s top five contributors to greenhouse gases?","textExplain":"定位：由题干的Brazil和top five contributors定位到文章最后一段末句。\n解析：定位句说，fires deliberately set by frontier settlers and developers hurl up almost half a billion metric tons of carbon a year, placing Brazil among the top five contributors to greenhouse gases in the world，“拓荒者和开发者蓄意点燃的大火，每年向空中排放将近5亿公吨的碳，使得巴西在全球温室气体排放量排行前五”。由此可知，拓荒者进行的焚烧行为使得巴西的温室气体排放量巨大。故B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The domino effect triggered by the perishing rain forests."},{"option":2,"content":"Its practice of burning forests for settlement and development."},{"option":3,"content":"The changed patterns of winds and rain in the Amazon area."},{"option":4,"content":"Its inability to curb the carbon emissions from industries."}]}]}]}
