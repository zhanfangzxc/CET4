The American public overwhelmingly thinks they're bad. Yet the consensus among most economists is that immigration, both legal and illegal, provides a small net boost to the economy. Immigrants provide cheap labor, lower the prices of everything from farm produce to new homes, and leave consumers with a little more money in their pockets. So why is there such a discrepancy between the perception of immigrants' impact on the economy and the reality?","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":579,"title":"What can we learn from the first paragraph?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干the first paragraph将本题定位于第一段。\n解析：第一段第二句说The American public overwhelmingly thinks they're bad，“绝大多数美国民众认为移民对经济没有好处”，第三句说Yet the consensus among most economists is that immigration … provides a small net boost to the economy，“然而大多数经济学家认为移民为经济带来了小幅度的增长”。即民众与经济学家在移民对经济的影响上的理解是不一样的，故D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/cet6/CET6_reading_video/030_CET6_tuililianxi1.mp4","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Whether immigrants are good or bad for the economy has been puzzling economists."},{"option":2,"content":"The American economy used to thrive on immigration but now it's a different story."},{"option":3,"content":"The consensus among economists is that immigration should not be encouraged."},{"option":4,"content":"The general public thinks differently from most economists on the impact of immigration."}]}]},{"id":3092,"name":"2009.6.52","content":"    For hundreds of millions of years, turtles (海龟) have struggled out of the sea to lay their eggs on sandy beaches, long before there were nature documentaries to celebrate them, or GPS satellites and marine biologists to track them, or volunteers to hand-carry the hatchlings (幼龟) down to the water’s edge lest they become disoriented by headlights and crawl towards a motel parking lot instead.
