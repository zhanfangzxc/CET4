[19]What he tried to do was to teach a male dolphin called Bass and a female called Doris to communicate with each other across a solid barrier.\nM: So how did he do it exactly?\nW: Well, first of all, he kept the two dolphins together in the same tank and taught them to press levers whenever they saw a light. [20]The levers were fitted to the side of the tank next to each other. If the light flashed on and off several times, the dolphins were supposed to press the left-hand lever followed by the right-hand one. If the light was kept steady, the dolphins were supposed to press the levers in reverse order. Whenever they responded correctly, they were rewarded with fish.\nM: Sounds terribly complicated.\nW: Well, that was the first stage. In the second stage, Doctor Bastian separated the dolphins into two tanks. They could still hear one another, but they couldn’t actually see each other. [21]The levers and light were set up in exactly the same way except that this time it was only Doris who could see the light indicating which lever to press first. But in order to get their fish, both dolphins had to press the levers in the correct order. This meant of course that Doris had to tell Bass whether it was a flashing light or whether it was a steady light.\nM: So did it work?\nW: Well, amazingly enough, the dolphins achieved a 100 % success rate.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/201206/20126C1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102641,"title":"What is the purpose of Doctor Jarvis Bastian’s experiment?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n文章开头处communicate with each other“与彼此交流”，与D选项communicate with each other构成视听一致。女士指出Jarvis Bastian博士实验的目的是看海豚是否能够隔着障碍物彼此交流，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"To test how responsive dolphins are to various signals."},{"option":2,"content":"To examine how long it takes dolphins to acquire a skill."},{"option":3,"content":"To find out if the female dolphin is cleverer than the male one."},{"option":4,"content":"To see if dolphins can learn to communicate with each other."}]},{"id":102642,"title":"What were the dolphins supposed to do when they saw a steady light?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n女士话中press the left-hand lever followed by the right-hand one“先左边杠杆后右边杠杆”和in reverse order“相反顺序”，与A选项right-hand lever first“先右边杠杆”构成同义替换，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Press the right-hand lever first."},{"option":2,"content":"Produce the appropriate sound."},{"option":3,"content":"Raise their heads above the water."},{"option":4,"content":"Swim straight into the same tank."}]},{"id":102643,"title":"How did the second stage of the experiment differ from the first stage?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词it was … who和only 处it was only Doris who could see the light“只有Doris能够看到灯光指示信号”，与C选项Only one dolphin was able to see the light“只有一只海豚能够看到灯光指示信号”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Both dolphins were put in the same tank."},{"option":2,"content":"The male dolphin received more rewards."},{"option":3,"content":"Only one dolphin was able to see the light."},{"option":4,"content":"The lever was beyond the dolphins’ reach."}]}]},{"id":4636,"name":"2012.6 Conversation Two","content":"W: This week’s program Up Your Street takes you to Harrogate, a small town in Yorkshire. [22]Harrogate became a fashionable resort during Victorian times, when people came to take a bath in the mineral waters. Today, few people come to visit the town for its mineral waters. [23]Instead, Harrogate has become a popular town for people to retire to. Its clean air, attractive parks, and the absence of any industry, make this an ideal spot for people looking for a quiet life. Now, to tell us more about Harrogate, I have with me Tom Percival, President of the Chamber of Commerce. Tom, one of the things visitor notices about Harrogate is the large area of open parkland right down into the middle of the town. Can you tell us more about it?\nM: Yes, certainly. The area is called the Stray.\nW: Why the Stray?\nM: It’s called that because in the old days, people let their cattle stray on the area, which was common land.\nW: Oh, I see.\nM: Then, with changes in farming and in land ownership, the Stray became part of the land owned by Harrogate.\nW: And is it protected?\nM: Oh, yes, indeed. [24]There is a special law, no one can build anything on the Stray. It’s protected forever.\nW: So it will always be parkland?\nM: That’s right. As you can see, some of the Stray is used for sports fields.\nW: I believe it looks lovely in the spring.\nM: Yes, it does. [25]There’re spring flowers on the old trees, and people visit the town just to see the flowers.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/201206/20126C2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102644,"title":"Where does this conversation most probably take place?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n文章开头处resort“度假胜地”，与B选项resort构成视听一致。Harrogate小镇是一个度假胜地，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"In a lecture room."},{"option":2,"content":"In a resort town."},{"option":3,"content":"In a botanical garden."},{"option":4,"content":"On a cattle farm."}]},{"id":102645,"title":"What do we learn about modern Harrogate?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词Instead后面for people to retire to“退休养老的地方”，与D选项for people to retire to构成视听一致。现在人们去Harrogate不是为了用矿物质水洗澡，而是退休养老，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It has kept many traditions from Victorian times."},{"option":2,"content":"It remains very attractive with its mineral waters."},{"option":3,"content":"It is at the centre of the fashion industry."},{"option":4,"content":"It is an ideal place for people to retire to."}]},{"id":102646,"title":"What does the man say about the area called the Stray?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n男士话中a special law… protected“受法律保护”，与D选项protected … by a special law构成视听一致。男士说Stray现在是受到法律保护的公园，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It was named after a land owner in the old days."},{"option":2,"content":"It will be used as a centre for athletic training."},{"option":3,"content":"It is located in the eastern part of Harrogate."},{"option":4,"content":"It is protected as parkland by a special law."}]},{"id":102647,"title":"What attracts people most in the Stray during the spring time?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词just之后flowers“花”，与C选项flowers构成视听一致。男士说人们来到这里为了观赏春天里的花，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The vast grassland."},{"option":2,"content":"The refreshing air."},{"option":3,"content":"The beautiful flowers."},{"option":4,"content":"The mineral waters."}]}]}]}
