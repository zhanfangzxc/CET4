He positioned the table so that he could move close to the audience— that’s the strategic point in the speech. He had read that speakers can be more persuasive if they invade the personal space of listeners, encouraging an emotional response. [17]For the same reason, he placed the chairs close to each other and raised the temperature to a slightly uncomfortable level. The purpose of the speech was to encourage the audience of corporate executives and local business owners to support local sports groups. To enhance his credibility with the audience, Larry had brought some slides of his family attending sports events. One photo showed him at an award ceremony, where he had been honored for his financial contribution to a local baseball team. Realizing that this particular audience would find his regional accent unattractive, Larry planned to speak with an accent that would be more acceptable to his audience. [18]After reading a book on how to address for success, he had purchased an expensive dark navy suit and a golden tie. He chose colors and styles known to communicate power and influence. [19]Just before people began entering the hall, Larry dimmed the lights and turned up the sound system, which was playing soft music, hoping to create a warm personal atmosphere for the speech. He hoped that these added effects would encourage his audience to support local sports teams. He had also planned the content of his speech to focus on the teams with the best records, the ones that had won the most games in the last season.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20131202/201312(2)P1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":103339,"title":"How can a speaker make himself more persuasive when delivering a speech?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词more和if之后invade the personal space of listeners，“进入到听众的私人空间”，与A选项构成视听一致。Speaker说使演讲更具有说服力的方法是侵入听众的私人空间，从而激起他们情感上的共鸣，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"By invading the personal space of listeners."},{"option":2,"content":"By making gestures at strategic points."},{"option":3,"content":"By speaking in a deep, loud voice."},{"option":4,"content":"By speaking with local accent."}]},{"id":103340,"title":"For what purpose was Larry going to make a speech?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词purpose之后encourage，“鼓励”；和support local sports groups “支持当地的体育团体”，与B选项构成视听一致。演讲的目的是让一些公司管理人员和地方企业家去支持当地的体育团体，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"To promote sportsmanship among business owners."},{"option":2,"content":"To encourage people to support local sports groups."},{"option":3,"content":"To raise money for a forthcoming local sports event."},{"option":4,"content":"To show his family’s contribution to the community."}]},{"id":103341,"title":"Why did Larry purchase an expensive navy suit and golden tie?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n文章中的communicate power and influence，“彰显气势和影响力”，与D选项中的communicate power and influence构成视听一致。Speaker为演讲特意购买海军蓝西装和金色领带，是为了显示气势和影响力，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They are known to be the style of the sports world."},{"option":2,"content":"They would certainly appeal to his audience."},{"option":3,"content":"They represent the latest fashion in the business circles."},{"option":4,"content":"They are believed to communicate power and influence."}]},{"id":103342,"title":"Why did Larry dim the lights and turned up the sound system before people entered the hall?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词hoping to之后create a warm personal atmosphere，“营造一种私人场合的温馨氛围”，与B选项构成视听一致。Larry在听众入场之前调暗灯光，播放轻音乐，是希望为演讲营造一种温馨的私人氛围，故B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"To cover up his own nervousness."},{"option":2,"content":"To create a warm personal atmosphere."},{"option":3,"content":"To enhance the effect of background music."},{"option":4,"content":"To allow the audience to better enjoy his slides."}]}]},{"id":5306,"name":"2013.12 (Passage Two 卷二)","content":"    [20]Phillis Wheatley was a young African-American slave who belonged to landowner John Wheatley in Colonial America. She was also a poet and the first African-American ever to publish a book. Her poems on various subjects, religious and moral, was printed in Boston in 1773, three years before the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Early slaves were generally denied education, but Wheatley was allowed by her owner to study poetry, Latin and the Bible. And by the time she reached her late teens, she had written enough poetry to put together a slender book of verse. [21]Even so, publication was difficult. The publisher, fearful of being cheated, forced her to submit to his scholarly examination by a board of educated men, including the colonial governor. The board of judges questioned Wheatley extensively and ruled that she was educated enough to have written the book. Only then was publication permitted. Wheatley may have been the first, but she was not the only slave to write books during the growing days of the Republic. Unfortunately, most of the early popular African-American writers have been all but forgotten in modern times until now. [22]A chronicle professor, Henry Louis Gates, recently studied a research project looking into 19th century African-American fiction and poetry. In the process he uncovered numerous lost works, almost half of which were written by African-American women. In very literary styles, the newly resurfaced manuscripts offered a rich stock of African-American culture, recreating among other things the early days of slavery and the importance of religion to the slaves.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20131202/201312(2)P2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":103343,"title":"What does the speaker say about Phillis Wheatley?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词first处the first African-American ever to publish a book，“第一位出版书籍的非裔美国人”，与D选项构成视听一致。文章中介绍Phillies Wheatley 是一个黑奴，同时是一位诗人，并且是第一位出版书籍的非裔美国人，故D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"She was the first educated slave of John Wheatley’s."},{"option":2,"content":"She was the greatest female poet in Colonial America."},{"option":3,"content":"She was born about the time of the War of Independence."},{"option":4,"content":"She was the first African-American slave to publish a book."}]},{"id":103344,"title":"What was Wheatley forced to do to get her book published?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词Even so后面scholarly examination，“学术审查”，与C选项中的scholarly examination构成视听一致。文章说Phillies Wheatley出版诗集非常困难，出版商由于担心被骗，强迫她进行学术审查，故C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Revise it a number of times."},{"option":2,"content":"Obtain consent from her owner."},{"option":3,"content":"Go through a scholarly examination."},{"option":4,"content":"Turn to the colonial governor for help."}]},{"id":103345,"title":"What did Prof. Henry Louis Gates uncover in the process of his research?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词almost处almost half of which were written by African-American women，“几乎一半的文学作品是由非裔美国女性所著”，与D选项Lots of lost works written by African-American women，“许多遗失的作品是由非裔美国女性所著”构成同义替换，故D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Literary works calling for the abolition of slavery."},{"option":2,"content":"Religious scripts popular among slaves in America."},{"option":3,"content":"A rich stock of manuscripts left by historical figures."},{"option":4,"content":"Lots of lost works written by African-American women."}]}]},{"id":5309,"name":"2013.12 (Passage Three 卷二)","content":"    In today’s personality stakes, nothing is more highly valued than the sense of humor. [23]We seek it out in others and are proud to claim it in ourselves, perhaps even more than good looks or intelligence. If someone has a great sense of humor, we reason, it means that they are happy, socially confident and have a healthy perspective on life. [24]This attitude would have surprised the ancient Greeks, who believed humor to be essentially aggressive. And in fact our admiration for the comically gifted is relatively new and not very well-founded, says Rod Martin, a psychologist at the University of Western Ontario. \n    “Being funny isn’t necessarily an indicator of good social skills and wellbeing,” his research has shown, “it may just exactly be a sign of personality flaws.” [25]He has found that humor is a double-edged sword. It can forge better relationships and help you cope with life, or it can be corrosive, eating away your self-esteem and irritating others. “It’s a form of communication like speech, and we all use it differently.” says Martin. We use bonding humor to enhance our social connections, but we also may employ it as a way of excluding or rejecting an outsider. \n    Though humor is essentially social, how you use it says a lot about your sense of self. Those who use self-defeating humor, making fun of themselves, of the enjoyment of others, tend to maintain that hostility toward themselves even when alone. Similarly, those who are able to view the world with amused tolerance are often equally forgiving of their own shortcomings.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20131202/201312(2)P3.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":103346,"title":"How do people today view humor according to the speaker?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词if处it means that they are happy, socially confident and have a healthy perspective on life，“这（有幽默感）说明他们是快乐的，在社交方面充满自信，并且拥有健康的生活态度”，与D选项It is a sign of happiness and confidence，“幽默是快乐和自信的象征”构成同义替换，故D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is a trait of generous character."},{"option":2,"content":"It is a trait of generous character."},{"option":3,"content":"It is an indicator of high intelligence."},{"option":4,"content":"It is a sign of happiness and confidence."}]},{"id":103347,"title":"What did ancient Greeks think of humor?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词essentially之后aggressive，“有侵略性的”，与B选项构成视听一致。文章说古希腊人认为幽默在本质上是具有侵略性的，故B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"t was self-defeating."},{"option":2,"content":"It was aggressive."},{"option":3,"content":"It was the essence of comedy."},{"option":4,"content":"It was something admirable."}]},{"id":103348,"title":"What has psychologist Rod Martin found about humor?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n原文中a double-edged sword，“双刃剑”，与A选项构成视听一致。文章说心理学家Rod Martin认为幽默是把双刃剑，故A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is a double-edged sword."},{"option":2,"content":"It is a feature of a given culture."},{"option":3,"content":"It is a unique gift of human beings."},{"option":4,"content":"It is a result of both nature and nurture."}]}]}]}
