[26]I thought the role of business schools was to develop future managers who knew all about the various functions of business.\n    [27]My thinking gradually became tempered by living and working outside the United States and by serving seven years as a college president. During my presidency of Babson College, I added several traits or skills that I felt a good manager must possess.\n    The first is the ability to express oneself in a clear, articulate fashion. Good oral and written communication skills are absolutely essential if one is to be an effective manager.\n    Second, one must possess that intangible set of qualities called leadership skills. To be a good leader, one must understand and be sensitive to people and be able to inspire them toward the achievement of common goals. \n    [28]Next, I concluded that effective managers must be broad human beings who not only understand the world of business but also have a sense of the cultural, social, political, historical, and the international aspects of life and society. This suggests that exposure to the liberal arts and humanities should be part of every manager's education.\n    [29]Finally, as I pondered the business and government-related scandals that have occupied the front pages of newspapers, it became clear that a good manager in today's world must have courage and a strong sense of integrity. He must know where to draw the line between right and wrong.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20121202/201212(2)P1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102763,"title":"What did the speaker use to think business schools should do to produce managers?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n文章开头处develop future managers who knew all about the various functions of business“培养全面了解商业功能的未来经理人”，与D选项teaching the various functions of business“教授各种商业功能”构成视听一致，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Encourage the students to do creative thinking."},{"option":2,"content":"Help the students to develop communication skills."},{"option":3,"content":"Cultivate the students’ ability to inspire employees."},{"option":4,"content":"Focus on teaching the various functions of business."}]},{"id":102764,"title":"What might have changed the speaker's viewpoint?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n原文中living and working outside the United States and by serving seven years as a college president“在美国国内外生活和工作多年以及任职大学校长七年时间”，与C选项presidency at college and experience overseas“大学校长的工作经历和海外的生活经历”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"His teaching career at the Harvard Business School."},{"option":2,"content":"His personal involvement in business management."},{"option":3,"content":"His presidency at college and experience overseas."},{"option":4,"content":"His education and professorship at Babson College."}]},{"id":102765,"title":"What does the speaker stress as part of manager's education?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词but后面exposure to the liberal arts and humanities“接触人文学科”，与B选项构成视听一致。Speaker强调每个经理人的必修课是接触人文学科，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Development of their raw brain power."},{"option":2,"content":"Exposure to the liberal arts and humanities."},{"option":3,"content":"Improvement of their ability in capital management."},{"option":4,"content":"Knowledge of up-to-date information technology."}]},{"id":102766,"title":"What convinced the speaker that managers need a sense of integrity?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词finally后面business and government-related scandals“商业及政府相关的丑闻”，与A选项business and government corruption“商业及政府相关的腐败”构成同义替换，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Reports on business and government corruption."},{"option":2,"content":"His contact with government and business circles."},{"option":3,"content":"Discoveries of cheating among MBA students."},{"option":4,"content":"The increasing influence of the mass media."}]}]},{"id":4758,"name":"2012.12 (Passage Two 卷二)","content":"    [30]With top colleges charging as much as $50 000 per year, the idea that students may spend their first two years learning next-to-nothing is enough to make parents pause. How can you make that investment worthwhile? And does going to college really make you smarter?\n    It depends on what you study and whether you study enough. \n    A discussion at The New York Times this week tackled the issue, with several academics weighing in on whether college is worthwhile, and whether schools are dumbing down their curricula to appeal to more people. [31]In their new book, Academically Adrift, sociologists Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa found that 32 percent of the students they followed did  not take \"any courses with more than 40 pages of reading per week\" in a typical semester, and half of the students didn't take \"any courses in which they had to write more than 20 pages for the class\". Using these criteria, they determined that 45 percent of college students make little academic progress during the first two years of a four-year degree.\n    Their research raises a few red flags. On the one hand, is it any surprise that a public school system forced to \"teach to the test\" produces large numbers of students who are unwilling to think analytically, learn on their own, or write a research paper? [32]On the other, does the number of pages read plus the number of pages written equal an accurate assessment of academic progress? A literature or history major, for instance, would have far more reading to do than a math major, but the math workload isn't lighter lifting just because it involves reading fewer pages per week.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20121202/201212(2)P2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102767,"title":"Why do parents hesitate to pay for their kids' college education according to the speaker?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n文章开头处first two years learning next-to-nothing“头两年里学到的东西几乎为零”，与C选项The quality of higher education may not be worth the tuition“高等教育的质量不值得这么贵的学费”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They have better options for their kids than colleges."},{"option":2,"content":"The unreasonably high tuition is beyond their means."},{"option":3,"content":"The quality of higher education may not be worth the tuition."},{"option":4,"content":"They think that their kids should pay for their own education."}]},{"id":102768,"title":"What does the survey by the two sociologists show about the students?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词not … more than处not take \"any courses with more than 40 pages of reading per week\" …didn't take \"any courses in which they had to write more than 20 pages for the class\"“不选修每周有40页以上阅读量的课程，不选修写作内容超过20页的课程”，与B选项select less demanding courses“选修低要求的课程”构成同义替换，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They do too many extracurricular activities."},{"option":2,"content":"They tend to select less demanding courses."},{"option":3,"content":"They take part-time jobs to support themselves."},{"option":4,"content":"They think few of the courses worth studying."}]},{"id":102769,"title":"What does the speaker imply about the research by the two sociologists?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n原文中academic progress“学术进步”，与D选项academic progress构成视听一致。Speaker对两位社会学家做的研究提出的质疑之一是学术进步是否等于阅读量加写作量，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Its samples are not representative enough."},{"option":2,"content":"Its significance should not be underestimated."},{"option":3,"content":"Its findings come as a surprise to many parents."},{"option":4,"content":"Its criteria for academic progress are questionable."}]}]},{"id":4761,"name":"2012.12 (Passage Three 卷二)","content":"    [35]Entertaining a close circle of friends isn't usually difficult. You all know each other so there's no problem about conversation. And even if the food is a bit sketchy, no one really minds because they've come to see you not get a free meal. Well, most of them anyway. [33]It's the guests you don't know very well who present unexpected traps. Therefore, in such categories as the new husband or wife, boyfriend or girlfriend of an intimate friend, the business acquaintances who may be useful to your career, worst of all, the totally unpredictable friend of a friend, my advice in such cases is if you're an indifferent cook, don't do any cooking. It's far better to stick to coffee and drinks, with a few expensive biscuits on the side. You can always plead that your flat is too small for more than two to eat comfortably, that you get home too late to prepare a decent meal, that your oven is on the blink. Any reasonable excuses will do, even it's not believed. [34]If you fancy yourself as a cook, and are anxious to make a good impression, do your homework first . Nothing is more discouraging than to spend hours preparing a delicious meat dish followed by, say, fresh strawberries, only to discover that your first time guest is a strict vegetarian or is on a slimming diet.
