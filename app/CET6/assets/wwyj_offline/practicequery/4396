[26]Of the 15,000 mice house there in a typical year, most give their lives for humanity. These are good mice and as such won the protection of the animal care committee. [27]At any given time, however, some mice escape and run free. These mice are pests. They can disrupt experiments with the bacteria organisms they carry. They are bad mice and must be captured and destroyed. Usually, this is accomplished by means of sticky traps, a kind of fly paper on which they become increasingly stuck. But the real point of the cautionary tale, says animal behaviorist Herzag, is that the labels we put on things can affect our moral responses to them. Using stick traps or the more deadly snap traps would be deemed unacceptable for good mice. Yet the killing of bad mice requires no prior approval. [28]Once a research animal hits the floor and becomes an escapee, says Herzag, its moral standard is instantly diminished. In Herzag’s own home, there was a more ironic example. When his young son’s pet mouse Willy died recently, it was accorded a tearful ceremonial burial in garden. [29]Yet even as they mourned Willy, says Herzag, he and his wife were setting snap traps to kill the pest mice in their kitchen .With the bare change in labels from pet to pest, the kitchen mice obtained totally different moral status.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/201112/201112P1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102733,"title":"What does the passage say about most of the mice used for experiments?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词most后面give their lives for humanity“为了人类奉献出自己的生命”，与C选项sacrifice their lives for the benefit of humans“为了人类的利益牺牲自己的生命”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They are labeled pet animals by the researchers."},{"option":2,"content":"They are looked after by animal-care organizations."},{"option":3,"content":"They sacrifice their lives for the benefit of humans."},{"option":4,"content":"They look spotlessly clean throughout their lives."}]},{"id":102734,"title":"Why did the so-called bad mice have to be captured and destroyed?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词however后面disrupt experiments“干扰实验”，与B选项“affect the results of experiments“影响实验结果”构成同义替换。所谓的坏老鼠必须被捕杀，是因为这些老鼠携带的病菌可能会影响实验，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They may breed out of control."},{"option":2,"content":"They may affect the results of experiments."},{"option":3,"content":"They may cause damage to the environment."},{"option":4,"content":"They may behave abnormally."}]},{"id":102735,"title":"When are mice killed without prior approval?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n原文中becomes an escapee“成为逃脱者”，与D选项become escapees构成视听一致。当老鼠逃跑时，不需要预先批准就能杀死它们，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"When they get too old."},{"option":2,"content":"When they become ill."},{"option":3,"content":"When they are no longer useful."},{"option":4,"content":"When they become escapees."}]},{"id":102736,"title":"Why does the speaker say what the Herzag’s did at home is ironical?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词Yet处pet mouse“宠物鼠”，ceremonial burial“纪念葬礼”和kill the pest mice“杀死害鼠”，与A选项burial ceremony for a pet mouse…killing pest mice构成视听一致。有点讽刺意味的是：Herzag小儿子的宠物老鼠死掉之后全家给它办葬礼，但Herzag夫妇同时却在捕杀厨房里的为害老鼠，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"While holding a burial ceremony for a pet mouse, they were killing pest mice."},{"option":2,"content":"While launching animal protection campaigns, they were trapping kitchen mice."},{"option":3,"content":"While calling for animal rights, they allowed their kids to keep pet animals."},{"option":4,"content":"While advocating freedom for animals, they kept their pet mouse in a cage."}]}]},{"id":4728,"name":"2011.12 Passage Two","content":"    [30]There are roughly three New Yorks. There is, first, the New York of the man or woman who was born here, who takes the city for granted and accepts its size and its turbulence as natural and inevitable. Second, there is the New York of the commuter—the city that is swallowed up by locusts each day and spat out each night. Third, there is the New York of the person who was born somewhere else and came to New York in quest of something. Of these three trembling cities, the greatest is the last—the city of final destination, the city that is a goal. It is this third city that accounts for New York's high-strung disposition, its dedication to the arts, and its incomparable achievements. [31]Commuters give the city its tidal restlessness; natives give it solidity and continuity; but the settlers give it passion. And whether it is a farmer arriving from Italy to set up a small grocery store in a slum, or a young girl arriving from a small town in Mississippi to escape the indignity of being observed by her neighbors, or a boy arriving from the Corn Belt with a manuscript in his suitcase and a pain in his heart, it makes no difference: Each embraces New York with the intense excitement of first love; [32]each absorbs New York with the fresh eyes of an adventurer; each generates heat and light to dwarf the Consolidated Edison Company.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/201112/201112P2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102737,"title":"What does the speaker say about the natives of New York?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词first后面takes the city for granted“认为这座城市就应该是这样”，与D选项take it for granted构成视听一致。文章说出生在这里的人理所当然的认为这座城市就是这样，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They are crazy about it."},{"option":2,"content":"They often find fault with it."},{"option":3,"content":"They contribute most to it."},{"option":4,"content":"They take it for granted."}]},{"id":102738,"title":"What does the speaker say commuters give to New York?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n原文中tidal restlessness“潮汐般忙碌不休”，与C选项Tidal restlessness构成视听一致。第二种纽约人是commuters，它们给纽约带来潮汐般的忙碌不休，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Heat and light."},{"option":2,"content":"Economic prosperity."},{"option":3,"content":"Tidal restlessness."},{"option":4,"content":"Historical continuity."}]},{"id":102739,"title":"What do we learn about the settlers of New York?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n文章结尾处adventurer“冒险家”，与A选项adventurers构成视听一致。第三种纽约人是settlers，每个人都带着冒险家的新鲜目光与纽约交融，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They are adventurers from all over the world."},{"option":2,"content":"They have difficulty surviving."},{"option":3,"content":"They find the city alien to them."},{"option":4,"content":"They lack knowledge of the culture of the city."}]}]},{"id":4731,"name":"2011.12 Passage Three","content":"    [34]“If you ask me television is unhealthy,” I said to my roommate Walter, as I walked into the living room. “Why you are sitting passively in front of the T.V. set?
