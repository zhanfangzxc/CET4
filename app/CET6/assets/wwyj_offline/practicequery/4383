I have schemes. I have charts. I have diagrams. It doesn’t mean to say that I always get it right, but I do plan before I begin writing. But what is so fascinating is how a book changes during the process of writing. It seems to me that creative writing is a process of revelation, really, rather than of creativity in the ordinary sense.\nW: When you’re planning the basic structure, do you like to go away to be sure that you’re by yourself?\nM: I need to be by myself certainly, absolutely. I can’t even bare anybody else in the house. [20]I don’t mind much where I am as long as I’ve got enough space to write, but I need to be completely alone.\nW: Is that very important to you?\nM: Oh, yes. I’ve never been lonely in all my life.\nW: How extraordinary! Never?\nM: No, never.\nW: You’re very lucky. Someone once said that there’s a bit of ice at the heart of every writer.\nM: Yes. I think this is true. The writer can stand aside from experience and look at it, watch it happening. [21]There is this ‘detachment’ and I realize that there are obviously experiences which would overwhelm everyone. But very often, a writer can appear to stand aside, and this detachment makes people feel there’s a bit of ice in the heart.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/201012/201012C1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102620,"title":"What is the key to write a good classical detective story according to the man?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词because和just后面carefully plotted and carefully clued“仔细安排情节和线索”，与D选项Careful plotting and clueing构成视听一致。男士说写侦探小说的关键是仔细安排情节和线索，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Unique descriptive skills.

Because British railways are a nationalized industry. There’s only one railway system in the country. [22]If you don’t like a particular kind of big beans, you can go and buy another. But if you don't like a particular railway, you can’t go and use another.\nM:Some people who write to me say this. [23]They say that if you didn’t have a monopoly, you wouldn’t be able to do the things you do. Well, I don’t think we do anything deliberately to upset our customers. We have particular problems. Since 1946, when the Transport Act came in, we were nationalized.\nW: Do you think that’s a good thing? Has it been a good thing for the railways, do you think, to be nationalized?\nM: Oh, I think so, yes. [24]Because in general, modes of transport are all around. Let’s face the fact. The car arrived. The car is here to stay. There is no question about that.\nW: So what are you saying then? Is it if the railways haven’t been nationalized, they would simply have disappeared?\nM: Oh, I think they would have. They’re disappearing fast in America. [25]Er, the French railways lose 1 billion pounds a year. The German railways, 2 billion pounds a year. But you see, those governments are prepared to pour money into the transport system to keep it going.\nW: So in a sense, you cope between two extremes. On the one hand, you’re trying not to lose too much money. And on the other hand, you’ve got to provide the best service.\nM: Yes, you are right.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/201012/201012C2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102623,"title":"What does the woman say about British railways?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词But和if后面if you don't like a particular railway, you can’t go and use another“不喜欢坐火车，也不能使用其他的交通工具”，与B选项Like it or not, you have to use them“不论喜欢与否都得坐火车”构成同义替换，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Good or bad, they are there to stay."},{"option":2,"content":"Like it or not, you have to use them."},{"option":3,"content":"Believe it or not, they have survived."},{"option":4,"content":"Gain or lose, they should be modernised."}]},{"id":102624,"title":"What do some people who write to the man complain about?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词if后面monopoly“垄断”，与D选项monopoly构成视听一致。人们写信给他抱怨铁路垄断问题，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The frequent train delays."},{"option":2,"content":"The high train ticket fares."},{"option":3,"content":"The food sold on the trains."},{"option":4,"content":"The monopoly of British Railways."}]},{"id":102625,"title":"What does the man say threatens the existence of railways?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词Because后面modes of transport“各种交通方式”，与B选项modes of transport构成视听一致。对铁路系统构成威胁的是众多交通方式的竞争，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The low efficiency of their operation."},{"option":2,"content":"Competition from other modes of transport."},{"option":3,"content":"Constant complaints from passengers."},{"option":4,"content":"The passing of the new transport act."}]},{"id":102626,"title":"What does the man say about railways in other countries?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n男士话中French railways lose 1 billion pounds a year…“法国铁路每年亏损10亿英镑…”，与D选项They lose a lot of money“损失很多钱”构成同义替换。男士以德、法两国铁路为例，说铁路每年都有大量亏损，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They will be de-nationalised."},{"option":2,"content":"They provide worse service."},{"option":3,"content":"They are fast disappearing."},{"option":4,"content":"They lose a lot of money."}]}]}]}
