In a world struggling with rapid industrialization, science and technology seemed to offer solutions to almost every problem. Newly created state colleges and universities devoted themselves almost entirely to scientific, technological, and engineering fields. Many Americans came to believe that scientific certainty could not only solve scientific problems, but also reform politics, government, and business. Two world wars and a Great Depression rocked the confidence of many people that scientific expertise alone could create a prosperous and ordered world. After World War Ⅱ, the academic world turned with new enthusiasm to humanistic studies, which seemed to many scholars the best way to ensure the survival of democracy. American scholars fanned out across much of the world—with support from the Ford Foundation, the Fulbright program, etc.—to promote the teaching of literature and the arts in an effort to make the case for democratic freedoms.\n    In the America of our own time, the great educational challenge has become an effort to strengthen the teaching of what is now known as the STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, and math). There is considerable and justified concern that the United States is falling behind much of the rest of the developed world in these essential disciplines. India, China, Japan, and other regions seem to be seizing technological leadership.\n    At the same time, perhaps inevitably, the humanities—while still popular in elite colleges and universities—have experienced a significant decline. Humanistic disciplines are seriously underfunded, not just by the government and the foundations but by academic institutions themselves. Humanists are usually among the lowest-paid faculty members at most institutions and are often lightly regarded because they do not generate grant income and because they provide no obvious credentials (资质) for most nonacademic careers.\n    Undoubtedly American education should train more scientists and engineers. Much of the concern among politicians about the state of American universities today is focused on the absence of “real world” education—which means preparation for professional and scientific careers. But the idea that institutions or their students must decide between humanities and science is false. Our society could not survive without scientific and technological knowledge. But we would be equally impoverished (贫困的) without humanistic knowledge as well. Science and technology teach us what we can do. Humanistic thinking helps us understand what we should do.\n    It is almost impossible to imagine our society without thinking of the extraordinary achievements of scientists and engineers in building our complicated world. But try to imagine our world as well without the remarkable works that have defined our culture and values. We have always needed, and we still need, both.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103090,"title":"In the early 20th century Americans believed science and technology could _______.","textExplain":"定位：据题干信息词20th century定位于第一段第一句。\n解析：第一句未出现答案，再往后看一句，第二句说 science and technology seemed to offer solutions to almost every problem，“科学技术看起来可以提供任何问题的解决方案”，即A选项中所说“解决几乎所有现存的问题”。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"solve virtually all existing problems"},{"option":2,"content":"help raise people’s living standards"},{"option":3,"content":"quicken the pace of industrialization"},{"option":4,"content":"promote the nation’s social progress"}]},{"id":103091,"title":"Why did many American scholars become enthusiastic about humanistic studies after World WarⅡ?","textExplain":"定位：据题干信息词World WarⅡ定位于第一段倒数第二句。\n解析：定位句说第二次世界大战之后学术界的热情转向人文学科研究，学者们认为人文学科是保证民主存续的最佳途径。定位句前一句Two world wars and a Great Depression rocked the confidence of many people that scientific expertise alone could create a prosperous and ordered world，“两次世界大战和美国经济大萧条动摇了人们只靠科学技术就能创造繁荣有序的世界的想法”。这两句话合起来的意思就是D选项所说的仅靠科技不能保证拥有更好的世界。.","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They wanted to improve their own status within the current education system."},{"option":2,"content":"They believed the stability of a society depended heavily on humanistic studies."},{"option":3,"content":"They could get financial support from various foundations for humanistic studies."},{"option":4,"content":"They realized science and technology alone were no guarantee for a better world."}]},{"id":103092,"title":"Why are American scholars worried about education today?","textExplain":"定位：据题干信息词worried about education today定位于第二段第一句和第二句。\n解析：根据第二段第二句the United States is falling behind much of the rest of the developed world in these essential disciplines，“美国在这些重要学科上落后于世界上其它发达国家”，所以美国学者担心的问题就是C选项中所说在STEM学科中落后的问题。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The STEM subjects are too challenging for students to learn."},{"option":2,"content":"Some Asian countries have overtaken America in basic sciences."},{"option":3,"content":"America is lagging behind in the STEM disciplines."},{"option":4,"content":"There are not enough scholars in humanistic studies."}]},{"id":103093,"title":"What accounts for the significant decline in humanistic studies today?","textExplain":"定位：据题干信息词significant decline定位到第三段第一句。\n解析：从定位句说人文学科规模经历大幅下降。定位句后一句中给出下降原因，Humanistic disciplines are seriously underfunded，“人文学科经费支持严重不足”，所以A选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Insufficient funding."},{"option":2,"content":"Shrinking enrollment."},{"option":3,"content":"Shortage of devoted faculty."},{"option":4,"content":"Dim prospects for graduates."}]},{"id":103094,"title":"Why does the author attach so much importance to humanistic studies?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干“为什么作者十分重视人文学科学习”，即作者的态度，定位到全文最后一段。\n解析：根据最后最后一段第二句，… the remarkable works that have defined our culture and values，“那些给我们的文化和价值观下定义的伟大作品”，这里的remarkable works“伟大作品”说的就是人文主义思想的经典著作，即人文主义思想定义了我们的文化和价值观，所以C选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They promote the development of science and technology."},{"option":2,"content":"They help prepare students for their professional careers."},{"option":3,"content":"Humanistic thinking helps define our culture and values."},{"option":4,"content":"Humanistic thinking helps cultivate students’ creativity."}]}]},{"id":5061,"name":"2010.12 Passage Two","content":"    Will there ever be another Einstein? This is the undercurrent of conversation at Einstein memorial meetings throughout the year. A new Einstein will emerge, scientists say. But it may take a long time. After all, more than 200 years separated Einstein from his nearest rival, Isaac Newton.\n    Many physicists say the next Einstein hasn’t been born yet, or is a baby now. That’s because the quest for a unified theory that would account for all the forces of nature has pushed current mathematics to its limits. New math must be created before the problem can be solved.\n    But researchers say there are many other factors working against another Einstein emerging anytime soon.\n    For one thing, physics is a much different field today. In Einstein’s day, there were only a few thousand physicists worldwide, and the theoreticians who could intellectually rival Einstein probably would fit into a streetcar with seats to spare.\n    Education is different, too. One crucial aspect of Einstein’s training that is overlooked is the years of philosophy he read as a teenager—Kant, Schopenhauer and Spinoza, among others. It taught him how to think independently and abstractly about space and time, and it wasn’t long before he became a philosopher himself.\n    “The independence created by philosophical insight is—in my opinion—the mark of distinction between a mere artisan (工匠) or specialist and a real seeker after truth,” Einstein wrote in 1944.\n    And he was an accomplished musician. The interplay between music and math is well known. Einstein would furiously play his violin as a way to think through a knotty physics problem.\n    Today, universities have produced millions of physicists. There aren’t many jobs in science for them, so they go to Wall Street and Silicon Valley to apply their analytical skills to more practical—and rewarding—efforts.\n    “Maybe there is an Einstein out there today,” said Columbia University physicist Brian Greene, “but it would be a lot harder for him to be heard.”\n    Especially considering what Einstein was proposing.\n    “The actual fabric of space and time curving? My God, what an idea!” Greene said at a recent gathering at the Aspen Institute. “It takes a certain type of person who will bang his head against the wall because you believe you’ll find the solution.”\n    Perhaps the best examples are the five scientific papers Einstein wrote in his “miracle year” of 1905. These “thought experiments” were pages of calculations signed and submitted to the prestigious journal Annalen der Physik by a virtual unknown. There were no footnotes or citations.\n    What might happen to such a submission today?\n    “We all get papers like those in the mail,” Greene said. “We put them in the junk file.”","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103095,"title":"What do scientists seem to agree upon, judging from the first two paragraphs?","textExplain":"定位：据题干信息定位于第一二段。\n解析：根据第一段的3,4句，A new Einstein will emerge, scientists say.
