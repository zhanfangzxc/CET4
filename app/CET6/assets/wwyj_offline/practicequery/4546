Why can’t the herd be thinned the old-fashioned way? The small community of North Haven on Long Island is home to some 600 to 700 deer. The Department of Environmental Conservation estimates the optimum population at 60. The town has been browsed bare of vegetation except where gardens and shrubs are protected by high fences. \n    Drivers routinely collide with deer and there are so many dead bodies left by the side of the road that the town has made it a deal with a local pet cemetery to collect and dispose of the bodies. Some people in the town have become ill from deer transmitted diseases. [17]On the occasions when hunting has been tried, local animal rights people have worked to secure court orders against the hunts. And when that is failed, they stop the hunters, banging on pots and pans to alert the deer. Town meetings called to discuss the problem inevitably dissolved into confrontations. \n    The activists believe simply that the deer are not the problem. Some communities have even discussed the possibility of bringing wolves back into the ecological mix. [18]That means wolves in the suburbs of New York. It is almost too wonderful not to try it. The wolves would kill deer of course. They would also terrorize and kill dogs and cats, which is not what the suburban dwellers have in mind.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20131201/201312(1)P1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":103305,"title":"What do we learn about white-tailed deer in North Haven?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n文章开头关键词so … that和in fact后面，they’ve become a suburban nuisance and a health hazard，“它们已经成为郊区居民讨厌的东西，而且是一种健康危害”，与D选项中的They have become a headache to the community，“它们已经成为当地社区的麻烦”构成同义替换。文章说North Haven的白尾鹿数量大增，使得当地人很头疼，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They have fallen prey to wolves."},{"option":2,"content":"They have become a tourist attraction."},{"option":3,"content":"They have caused lots of damage to crops."},{"option":4,"content":"They have become a headache to the community."}]},{"id":103306,"title":"Why do local animal rights people bang on pots and pans?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n第二段中to alert the deer，“（目的是为了）让白尾鹿警戒起来”，与D选项构成视听一致。文章说动物保护主义者反对猎杀白尾鹿，他们敲击锅盆让白尾鹿警惕危险，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"To celebrate their victory."},{"option":2,"content":"To cheer up the hunters."},{"option":3,"content":"To scare the wolves."},{"option":4,"content":"To alert the deer."}]},{"id":103307,"title":"What would happen if wolves were brought back into the ecological mix?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n文章结尾处They would also terrorize and kill dogs and cats，“狼也会威胁并杀掉小猫小狗”，与C选项中的They would endanger domestic animals，“狼也会威胁到家畜的生命”构成同义替换。文章说把狼引入本地生态系统会危及到家畜的生命，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They would help to spread a fatal disease."},{"option":2,"content":"They would pose a threat to the children."},{"option":3,"content":"They would endanger domestic animals."},{"option":4,"content":"They would eventually kill off the deer."}]}]},{"id":5328,"name":"2013.12 (Passage Two 卷一)","content":"    [20]And now, if you’ll walk this way, ladies and gentlemen, the next room we’re going to see is the room in which the family used to hold their formal dinner parties and even occasionally entertain heads of state and royalty. However, they managed to keep this room friendly and intimate. And I think you’ll agree. It has a very informal atmosphere, quite unlike some grand houses you visit. The curtains were never drawn, even at night, so guests got a view of the lake and fountains outside which were lit up at night – a very attractive sight. \n    As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, the guests were seated very informally around this oval table, which would add to the relaxed atmosphere. [21]The table dates from the 18th century and is made from Spanish oak. It’s rather remarkable for the fact that although it’s extremely big, it’s supported by just six rather slim legs. However, it seems to have survived like that for 200 years. So it’s probably going to last a bit longer. [22]The chairs which go with the table are not a complete set. There were originally six of them. They are interesting for the fact that they are very plain and undecorated for the time, with only one plain central panel at the back and no armrests. I myself find them rather uncomfortable to sit in for very long, but people were used to more discomfort in the past.

[24]She had just graduated from college and got a job at an advertising agency when she began to sense that something strange was going on inside her body. When James realized how severe her illness was, she knew she had better hurry up and live life. [23]MS is the biggest crippler of young adults. And although she didn’t have many symptoms, she knew it was just a matter of time. First on her agenda was to pursue her dream of hosting a pop music program. She worked at a radio station for a year, always aware that her body was degenerating. Then her best friend moved away. And one night James began screaming, “I got to go! I got to go!” Two weeks later, she arrived at Alaska, thousands of miles from her friends, her family and her past. “Everything fell into a place,” she recalls. A 23-year-old girl with an incurable disease can fly to Alaska and everything can work out. The MS attacks came and went. And most of the time they hardly slowed her down. [25]James hiked, fished, learnt to sail and experimented with hot air ballooning. “I lived for adventure,” she says. “Nobody ever had a better time or did more exotic strange things than I did in an 80-year period.” Inevitably however, the day came when she was so weakened that she had to return to Pittsburgh, her hometown. There she began relieving her adventures by writing a book about them. Her book was published in 1993.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20131201/201312(1)P3.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":103311,"title":"What does the speaker say about MS?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词biggest处MS is the biggest crippler of young adults，“MS是青少年最大的致残因素”，与D选项构成视听一致，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is an uncommon infectious disease."},{"option":2,"content":"It destroys the patient’s ability to think."},{"option":3,"content":"It is a disease very difficult to diagnose."},{"option":4,"content":"It is the biggest crippler of young adults."}]},{"id":103312,"title":"What did Janet James decide to do after her disease was diagnosed?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词had better后面hurry up and live life，“抓紧时间，享受生命”，与B选项构成视听一致。Janet James发现自己患病之后，决定抓紧最后的时间，享受生命，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Search for the best cure."},{"option":2,"content":"Hurry up and live life."},{"option":3,"content":"Write a book about her life."},{"option":4,"content":"Exercise more and work harder."}]},{"id":103313,"title":"What sort of person can we infer Janet James is?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n原文引号中I lived for adventure，“我为冒险而活”，与B选项中的Adventurous“爱冒险的”构成同义替换。Janet James说她为冒险而活，也就是说她是个有冒险精神的人，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Aggressive."},{"option":2,"content":"Adventurous."},{"option":3,"content":"Sophisticated."},{"option":4,"content":"Self-centered."}]}]}]}
