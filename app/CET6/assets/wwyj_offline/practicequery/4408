The test is a simple one. The baby watches a sort of show on a small stage. In Act One of the show, a yellow cube is lifted from a blue box, and moved across the stage. Then it is returned to the box. This is repeated 6 times. [26]Act Two is similar except that the yellow cube is smaller. Baby boys do not react at all to the difference and the size of the cube. [27]But girls immediately become excited. The scientists interpret the girls’ excitement as meaning they are trying to understand what they have just seen. They are wondering why Act Two is odd and how it differs from Act One. In other words, the little girls are reasoning. [28]This experiment certainly does not definitely prove that girls start to reason before boys, but it provides a clue that scientists would like to study more carefully. Already it is known that bones, muscles and nerves develop faster in baby girls. Perhaps it is early nerve development that makes some infant girls show more intelligence than infant boys. Scientists have also found that nature seems to give another boost to girls. [29]Baby girls usually talk at an earlier age than boys do. Scientists think that there is a physical reason for this. They believe that the nerve endings in the left side of the brain develop faster in girls than in boys, and it is this side of the brain that strongly influences an individual’s ability to use language and remember things.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20121201/201212(1)P1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102753,"title":"What is the difference between Act One and Act Two in the test?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词except后面yellow cube is smaller“黄色的立方体小一些”，与B选项The size of the objects“物体的尺寸”构成同义替换，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The shape of the cubes used."},{"option":2,"content":"The size of the objects shown."},{"option":3,"content":"The number of times of repeating the process."},{"option":4,"content":"The weight of the boxes moving across the stage."}]},{"id":102754,"title":"How do the scientists interpret their observation from the experiment?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词but处boys do not react at all …But girls immediately become excited“男孩根本没反应，而女孩立即兴奋起来”，与C选项Girls seem to start reasoning earlier than boys“女孩似乎比男孩更早进行推理”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Boys enjoy playing with cubes more than girls."},{"option":2,"content":"Girls tend to get excited more easily than boys."},{"option":3,"content":"Girls seem to start reasoning earlier than boys."},{"option":4,"content":"Boys pay more attention to moving objects than girls."}]},{"id":102755,"title":"What does the speaker say about the experiment?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词but后面it provides a clue that scientists would like to study more carefully“它为科学家们开展深入的研究提供了线索”，与B选项stimulate scientists to make further studies“激发科学家们开展更深入的研究”构成同义替换，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is a breakthrough in the study of the nerve system."},{"option":2,"content":"It may stimulate scientists to make further studies."},{"option":3,"content":"Its result helps understand babies’ language ability."},{"option":4,"content":"Its findings are quite contrary to previous research."}]},{"id":102756,"title":"According to scientists, what is another advantage given to girls by nature?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n文章结尾处girls usually talk at an earlier age“女孩开始说话时间比较早”，与D选项They talk at an earlier age构成视听一致。女孩比男孩还有另外一个天生的优势是女孩开始说话时间比男孩早，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The two sides of their brain develop simultaneously."},{"option":2,"content":"They are better able to adapt to the surroundings."},{"option":3,"content":"Their bones mature earlier."},{"option":4,"content":"They talk at an earlier age."}]}]},{"id":4748,"name":"2012.12 (Passage Two 卷一)","content":"    [30]A superintendant of the city’s municipal building, Delia Sedona, was responsible for presenting its new security plan to the public. City employees, citizens and reporters gathered in the hall to hear her describe the plan. After outlining the main points she would cover, she assured the audience that she would be happy to answer questions at the end of her presentation. Delia realized the plan was expensive and potentially controversial. So she was not surprised to see a number of hands go up as soon as she finished speaking. [31]An employ asked, “Would the new system create long lines to get into the building like the line in the airport security checks?” Delia had anticipated this question and had an answer ready. After repeating the question, she explained that the sufficient number of security guards would be working at peak hours to speed things along. [32]The next question was more confrontational. “Where will the money come from to pay for all of this?” The journalists who asked the question seemed hostile. But Delia was careful not to adopt the defensive tone. She stated that the money would come from the city’s general budget. “I know these are tight times”, she added, “but everyone agrees on the importance of safeguarding our employees and members of the public who come into the building.” Near the end of the 25 minutes she has set, Delia said she would take two more questions. When those were finished, she concluded the session with a brief restatement of how the new system will improve security and peace of mind in the municipal building.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20121201/201212(1)P2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102757,"title":"What is the focus of Delia Sedona’s presentation?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n文章开头处new security plan“新的安保计划”，与A选项new security plan构成视听一致。Delia Sedona进行陈述的主题是市政大楼的安保计划，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The new security plan for the municipal building."},{"option":2,"content":"The blueprint for the development of the city."},{"option":3,"content":"The controversy over the new office regulations."},{"option":4,"content":"The city’s general budget for the coming year."}]},{"id":102758,"title":"What question had Delia Sedona anticipated?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n原文中create long lines“导致排长队的现象”，与C选项create long queues构成同义替换。Delia Sedona预料到的问题是安全检查是否会导致排长队的现象，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Whether the security checks were really necessary."},{"option":2,"content":"How to cope with the huge crowds of visitors to the municipal building."},{"option":3,"content":"Whether the security checks would create long queues at peak hours."},{"option":4,"content":"How to train the newly recruited security guards."}]},{"id":102759,"title":"What did the speakers think of the question from the journalist?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词more后面confrontational“有对抗性的”，与D选项构成视听一致。演讲者感到记者提出的问题很有敌意，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Irrelevant."},{"option":2,"content":"Straightforward."},{"option":3,"content":"Ridiculous."},{"option":4,"content":"Confrontational."}]}]},{"id":4751,"name":"2012.12 (Passage Three 卷一)","content":"    Despite unemployment and the lost of her home, Andrea Clark considers herself a blessed and happy woman. Why the cheerful attitude? Her troubles have brought her closer to her family. [33]Last year, Andrea’s husband, Rick, a miner in Nevada was laid off. Though Andrea kept her job as a school bus driver, she knew that they couldn’t pay their bill and support their youngest of five children, Zack, aged nine, on one income. “At first their church helped out, but you can’t keep that up forever,” Andrea says. Then Michael, their eldest of her four adult children suggested they move in with his family. For almost three months, seven Clarks lived under one roof. Andrea, Rick and Zack stayed in the basement department, sharing laundry and single bathroom with Michael, his wife and their two children.\n    [34]The change cut their expenditures in half, but the new living arrangement proved too challenging. When Andrea found a job with a school district closer to her mother’s home in West Jordan, Utah, the family decided to move on. Packing up again with no picnic, Zack had to switch schools for the second time and space is even tighter. Andrea says that the moves themselves are exhausting and Rick is still looking for a job.\n    [35]The recession has certainly come with more problems than Andrea anticipated, but she remains unfailingly optimistic. She is excited to spend more time with her mother. Another plus, rents are lower in Utah than in Nevada. So Andrea thinks they’ll be able to save up and move out in less than 6 months.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20121201/201212(1)P3.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102760,"title":"What do we learn about Andrea’s husband?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n原文中a miner in Nevada“内华达的一名矿工”，与A选项a miner in Nevada构成视听一致。Andrea Clark的丈夫曾经是内华达的一名矿工，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He used to work as a miner in Nevada."},{"option":2,"content":"He works hard to support his five kids."},{"option":3,"content":"He considers himself a blessed man."},{"option":4,"content":"He once taught at a local high school."}]},{"id":102761,"title":"Why did Andrea move to live in her eldest son’s home?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n原文中cut their expenditures in half“减少了一半的开销”，与C选项cut their living expenses“为了减少生活费用”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"To be nearer to Zac’s school."},{"option":2,"content":"To look after her grandchildren."},{"option":3,"content":"To cut their living expenses."},{"option":4,"content":"To help with the household chores."}]},{"id":102762,"title":"What is Andrea’s attitude toward the hardships brought by the economic recession?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词but后面optimistic“乐观的”，与B选项构成视听一致。对于经济衰退带来的困苦，Andrea还是很乐观的，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Skeptical."},{"option":2,"content":"Optimistic."},{"option":3,"content":"Indifferent."},{"option":4,"content":"Realistic."}]}]}]}
