She has 3 children and lives in the suburb outside Columbus, Ohio. When her youngest child reached school age, Jane decided to go back to work. [26]She thought that she should contribute to the household finances. Her salary could make the difference between the financial struggle and a secure financial situation for her family. Jane also felt bored and frustrated in her role as a homemaker and wanted to be more involved in life outside her home. Jane was worried about her children's adjustment to this new situation. But she arranged for them to go stay with a woman nearby after school each afternoon. They seem to be happy with the arrangement. The problem seems to be between Jane and her husband, Bill. [27]When Jane was at home all day, she was able to clean the house, go grocery shopping, wash the clothes, take care of the children and cook two or three meals each day. She was very busy, of course, but she succeeded in getting everything done. Now these same things need to be done. But Jane has only evenings and early mornings to do them. Both Jane and Bill are tired when they arrive home at 6 p.m. [28]Bill's accustomed to sitting down and reading the paper or watching TV until dinner is ready.  This is exactly what Jane feels like doing. But someone has to fix dinner and Bill expects that to be Jane. Jane's becoming very angry at Bill's attitude. [29]She feels that they should share the household jobs. But Bill feels that everything should be the same as it was before Jane went back to work.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20130603/20136(3)P1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102793,"title":"Why did Jane want to go back to work?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n文章开头处contribute to the household finances“为家庭经济贡献力量”，与C选项help with the family’s finances“帮助家庭的经济”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"She was bored with her idle life at home."},{"option":2,"content":"She was offered a good job by her neighbour."},{"option":3,"content":"She wanted to help with the family’s finances."},{"option":4,"content":"Her family would like to see her more involved in social life."}]},{"id":102794,"title":"How did Jane spend her days before she went back to work?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n原文中clean the house, go grocery shopping, wash the clothes, take care of the children and cook two or three meals each day“打扫房间、买东西、洗衣、照料孩子和做饭”，与A选项Doing housework“做家务”构成同义替换，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Doing housework."},{"option":2,"content":"Looking after her neighbour’s children."},{"option":3,"content":"Reading papers and watching TV."},{"option":4,"content":"Taking good care of her husband."}]},{"id":102795,"title":"What problem arose when Jane went back to work?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n原文中Bill's accustomed to sitting down and reading the paper or watching TV until dinner is ready“Bill已经习惯了坐下来看报纸看电视直到晚饭做好”，与B选项Bill failed to adapt to the new situation“Bill没有适应新的情况”构成同义替换，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Jane got angry at Bill’s idle life."},{"option":2,"content":"Bill failed to adapt to the new situation."},{"option":3,"content":"Bill blamed Jane for neglecting the family."},{"option":4,"content":"The children were not taken good care of."}]},{"id":102796,"title":"What does the story try to tell us?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n文章结尾处share the household jobs“分担家务”，与C选项share household duties构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Neighbours should help each other."},{"option":2,"content":"Woman should have their own careers."},{"option":3,"content":"Man and wife should share household duties."},{"option":4,"content":"Parents should take good care of their children."}]}]},{"id":4788,"name":"2013.6 (Passage Two 卷三)","content":"    The Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction is a program designed to reduce the impact of natural disasters throughout the world. With support from United Nations, countries will be encouraged to share information about disaster reduction, for instance, information about how to plan for and cope with hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters. One of the most important things the program plans to do is to remind us of what we can do to protect ourselves. For example, we can pack a suitcase with flashlights, a radio, food, drinking water and some tools. This safety kit may help us survive a disaster until help arrives. Besides, the program will encourage governments to establish building standards, emergency response plans and training programs. [30]These measures can help to limit the destruction by natural disasters. [31]The comparatively mild effects of the northern California earthquake in 1989, are good evidence that we do have the technology to prevent vast destruction. The recent disasters, on the other hand, prove that people will suffer if we don't use that technology. When a highway collapsed in northern California, people were killed in their cars. [32]The highway was not built according to today's strict standards to resist earthquakes. Individuals and governments have to be farsighted. We should take extra time and spend extra money to build disaster safety into our lives. Although such a program can't hold back the winds or stop earthquakes, it can save people's lives and homes.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20130603/20136(3)P2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102797,"title":"What is the purpose of the program mentioned in this passage?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n原文中limit the destruction by natural disasters“限制自然灾害所造成的破坏”，与B选项limit the destruction … natural disasters构成视听一致。这个项目的目的是限制自然灾害所造成的破坏，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"To predict natural disasters that can cause vast destruction."},{"option":2,"content":"To limit the destruction that natural disasters may cause."},{"option":3,"content":"To gain financial support from the United Nations."},{"option":4,"content":"To propose measures to hold back natural disasters."}]},{"id":102798,"title":"What can we learn from the northern California earthquake in 1989?

But believe it or not, the area surrounding Mount Etna in Italy is packed with people. In fact, it is the most densely-populated region on the whole island of Sicily. The reason is that rich volcanic soil makes the land fantastic for farming. By growing and selling a variety of crops, local people earn a good living. For them, the economic benefit they reap surpasses the risk of dying or losing property in one of the volcano's frequent eruptions.\n    [33]People everywhere make decisions about risky situations this way, that is, by comparing the risks and the benefits. According to the experts, the size of the risk depends on both its probability and seriousness. Let's take Mount Etna for example. It does erupt frequently. [34] But  those eruptions are usually minor. [35]So the overall risk for people living nearby is relatively small. But suppose Mount Etna erupted everyday or imagine that each eruption there killed thousands of people. If that were the case, the risk would be much larger. Indeed, the risk would be too large for many people to live with. And they would have to move away.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20130603/20136(3)P3.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102800,"title":"How do people make decisions about risky situations?
