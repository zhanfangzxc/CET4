The American public overwhelmingly thinks they're bad. Yet the consensus among most economists is that immigration, both legal and illegal, provides a small net boost to the economy. Immigrants provide cheap labor, lower the prices of everything from farm produce to new homes, and leave consumers with a little more money in their pockets. So why is there such a discrepancy between the perception of immigrants' impact on the economy and the reality?\n    There are a number of familiar theories. Some argue that people are anxious and feel threatened by an inflow of new workers. Others highlight the strain that undocumented immigrants place on public services, like schools, hospitals, and jails. Still others emphasize the role of race, arguing that foreigners add to the nation's fears and insecurities. There's some truth to all these explanations, but they aren't quite sufficient.\n    To get a better understanding of what's going on, consider the way immigration's impact is felt. Though its overall effect may be positive, its costs and benefits are distributed unevenly. David Card, an economist at UC Berkeley, notes that the ones who profit most directly from immigrants' low-cost labor are businesses and employers—meatpacking plants in Nebraska, for instance, or agricultural businesses in California. Granted, these producers' savings probably translate into lower prices at the grocery store, but how many consumers make that mental connection at the checkout counter? As for the drawbacks of illegal immigration, these, too, are concentrated. Native low-skilled workers suffer most from the competition of foreign labor. According to a study by George Borjas, a Harvard economist, immigration reduced the wages of American high-school dropouts by 9% between 1980-2000.\n    Among high-skilled, better-educated employees, however, opposition was strongest in states with both high numbers of immigrants and relatively generous social services. What worried them most, in other words, was the fiscal (财政的)burden of immigration. That conclusion was reinforced by another finding: that their opposition appeared to soften when that fiscal burden decreased, as occurred with welfare reform in the 1990s, which curbed immigrants' access to certain benefits.\n    The irony is that for all the overexcited debate, the net effect of immigration is minimal. Even for those most acutely affected say, low-skilled workers, or California residents the impact isn't all that dramatic. \"The unpleasant voices have tended to dominate our perceptions,\" says Daniel Tichenor, a political science professor at the University of Oregon. \"But when all those factors are put together and the economists calculate the numbers, it ends up being a net positive, but a small one.\" Too bad most people don't realize it.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103100,"title":"What can we learn from the first paragraph?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干the first paragraph将本题定位于第一段。\n解析：第一段第二句说The American public overwhelmingly thinks they're bad，“绝大多数美国民众认为移民对经济没有好处”，第三句说Yet the consensus among most economists is that immigration … provides a small net boost to the economy，“然而大多数经济学家认为移民为经济带来了小幅度的增长”。即民众与经济学家在移民对经济的影响上的理解是不一样的，故D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Whether immigrants are good or bad for the economy has been puzzling economists."},{"option":2,"content":"The American economy used to thrive on immigration but now it's a different story."},{"option":3,"content":"The consensus among economists is that immigration should not be encouraged."},{"option":4,"content":"he general public thinks differently from most economists on the impact of immigration."}]},{"id":103101,"title":"In what way does the author think ordinary Americans benefit from immigration?","textExplain":"定位：通过benefit 和immigration将本题定位于第一段第三句。\n解析：第一段第三句说Immigrants provide cheap labor, lower the prices of everything from farm produce to new homes, and leave consumers with a little more money in their pockets，“移民提供廉价劳动力，降低从农产品到新房中所需物品的价格，并让消费者省下更多的钱”。即B选项中“提供更便宜的消费商品”为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They can access all kinds of public services."},{"option":2,"content":"They can get consumer goods at lower prices."},{"option":3,"content":"They can mix with people of different cultures."},{"option":4,"content":"They can avoid doing much of the manual labor."}]},{"id":103102,"title":"Why do native low-skilled workers suffer most from illegal immigration?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的native low-skilled workers suffer most将本题定位于第三段最后两句。\n解析：第三段倒数第二句话说Native low-skilled workers suffer most from the competition of foreign labor，“本地的技术较低的工人受到外来工人的竞争”。第三段最后一句说immigration reduced the wages of American high-school dropouts by 9% between 1980-2000，“移民使得美国高中辍学者的薪酬降低了9%”。即低技能工人受到的主要影响是薪酬降低，故C选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They have greater difficulty getting welfare support."},{"option":2,"content":"They are more likely to encounter interracial conflicts."},{"option":3,"content":"They have a harder time getting a job with decent pay."},{"option":4,"content":"They are no match for illegal immigrants in labor skills."}]},{"id":103103,"title":"What is the chief concern of native high-skilled, better-educated employees about the inflow of immigrants?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的high-skilled, better-educated employees将本题定位于第四段第一、二句。\n解析：第四段第一句说受过良好教育的高级技术员工反对的是庞大的移民数量和过于慷慨的社会服务。后面一句说What worried them most, in other words, was the fiscal (财政的)burden of immigration，“他们最担心的是移民带来的财政负担”。即D选项为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It may change the existing social structure."},{"option":2,"content":"It may pose a threat to their economic status."},{"option":3,"content":"It may lead to social instability in the country."},{"option":4,"content":"It may place a great strain on the state budget."}]},{"id":103104,"title":"What is the irony about the debate over immigration?

In it the majority of students will have conformed to the standard model of the time: male, middle class and Western. Walk into a class today, however, and you'll get a completely different impression. For a start, you will now see plenty more women the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, for example, boasts that 40% of its new enrollment is female. You will also see a wide range of ethnic groups and nationals of practically every country.\n    It might be tempting, therefore, to think that the old barriers have been broken down and equal opportunity achieved. But, increasingly this apparent diversity is becoming a mask for a new type of conformity. Behind the differences in sex, skin tones and mother tongues, there are common attitudes, expectations and ambitions which risk creating a set of clones among the business leaders of the future.\n    Diversity, it seems, has not helped to address fundamental weaknesses in business leadership. So what can be done to create more effective managers of the commercial world? According to Valerie Gauthier, associate dean at HEC Paris, the key lies in the process by which MBA programmers recruit their students. At the moment candidates are selected on a fairly narrow set of criteria such as prior academic and career performance, and analytical and problem solving abilities. This is then coupled to a school's picture of what a diverse class should look like, with the result that passport, ethnic origin and sex can all become influencing factors. But schools rarely dig down to find out what really makes an applicant succeed, to create a class which also contains diversity of attitude and approach arguably the only diversity that, in a business context, really matters.\n    Professor Gauthier believes schools should not just be selecting candidates from traditional sectors such as banking, consultancy and industry. They should also be seeking individuals who have backgrounds in areas such as political science, the creative arts, history or philosophy, which will allow them to put business decisions into a wider context.\n    Indeed, there does seem to be a demand for the more rounded leaders such diversity might create. A study by Mannaz, a leadership development company, suggests that, while the bully-boy chief executive of old may not have been eradicated completely, there is a definite shift in emphasis towards less tough styles of management—at least in America and Europe. Perhaps most significant, according to Mannaz, is the increasing interest large companies have in more collaborative management models, such as those prevalent in Scandinavia, which seek to integrate the hard and soft aspects of leadership and encourage delegated responsibility and accountability.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103105,"title":"What characterizes the business school student population of today?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的business school student of today将本题定位于第一段。\n解析：第一段说的是今天的商科学校与20年前相比，学生的构成发生了彻底的改变。第一段第四句话中boasts that 40% of its new enrollment is female，“骄傲地说40%的生源是女生”。最后一句话You will also see a wide range of ethnic groups and nationals of practically every country，“你也会看到几乎所有国家的不同民族的人”。即女性比例增加了，而且民族也更加多样化了，即A选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Greater diversity."},{"option":2,"content":"Intellectual maturity."},{"option":3,"content":"Exceptional diligence."},{"option":4,"content":"Higher ambition."}]},{"id":103106,"title":"What is the author's concern about current business school education?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的author's concern 和current business school education将本题定位于第二段最后一句。\n解析：定位句说，Behind the differences in sex, skin tones and mother tongues, there are common attitudes, expectations and ambitions which risk creating a set of clones among the business leaders of the future，“在性别、肤色和母语差异的背后，存在很多相同的态度、期望和抱负，这些都在为未来商业领袖中创造出一批毫无特性的克隆人埋下隐患”。即现在的商学教育输出的是毫无个性的人，故B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It will arouse students' unrealistic expectations."},{"option":2,"content":"It will produce business leaders of a uniform style."},{"option":3,"content":"It focuses on theory rather than on practical skills."},{"option":4,"content":"It stresses competition rather than cooperation."}]},{"id":103107,"title":"What aspect of diversity does Valerie Gauthier think is most important?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的Valerie Gauthier将本题定位于原文第三段第一句到该段结束。\n解析；该段全段都是Valerie Gauthier的观点。最后一句说很少有学校能够深挖一个人成功的真正原因，也很少有学校去创造能够容纳态度和方法多样性的课堂，而这种多样性正是商业环境中真正重要的。即Valerie Gauthier认为态度和方法的多样性最为重要，故C选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Age and educational background."},{"option":2,"content":"Social and professional experience."},{"option":3,"content":"Attitude and approach to business."},{"option":4,"content":"Ethnic origin and gender."}]},{"id":103108,"title":"What applicants does the author think MBA programmers should consider recruiting?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的applicants将本题定位于文章第四段第一句（candidates）。\n解析：定位句后面一句说，They should also be seeking individuals who have backgrounds in areas such as political science, the creative arts, history or philosophy, which will allow them to put business decisions into a wider context，“学校还应该将那些有政治学、创造性艺术、历史或哲学等领域背景的人吸纳进来”。即商科学校应该引入其它教育背景的人才，故C选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Applicants with prior experience in business companies."},{"option":2,"content":"Applicants with sound knowledge in math and statistics."},{"option":3,"content":"Applicants from outside the traditional sectors."},{"option":4,"content":"Applicants from less developed regions and areas."}]},{"id":103109,"title":"What does Mannaz say about the current management style?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的Mannaz和the current management style将本题定位于最后一段第二、三句。\n解析：由定位句可知，Mannaz公司认为，there is a definite shift in emphasis towards less tough styles of management，“管理方式确实向着更加宽松的方式转变”。后面一句说Perhaps most significant, according to Mannaz, is the increasing interest large companies have in more collaborative management models，“最重要的是大型企业对协作化的管理模式的兴趣不断增加”。即管理方式变得更加协作化，故正确选项为D。 ","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is eradicating the tough aspects of management."},{"option":2,"content":"It encourages male and female executives to work side by side."},{"option":3,"content":"It adopts the bully-boy chief executive model."},{"option":4,"content":"It is shifting towards more collaborative models."}]}]}]}
