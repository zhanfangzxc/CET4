But there's no easy way to see what those figures mean in real life. During the presidential campaign, Barack Obama assembled a racially and ideologically diverse coalition with his message of hope and change; as the reality of life under a new administration settles in, some of those supporters might become disillusioned. As the nation moves further into the Obama presidency, will politically engaged young people continue to support the president and his agenda, or will they gradually drift away?\n    The writers of Generation O (short for Obama), a new Newsweek blog that seeks to chronicle the lives of a group of young Obama supporters, want to answer that question. For the next three months, Michelle Kremer and 11 other Obama supporters, ages 19 to 34, will blog about life across mainstream America, with one twist: by tying all of their ideas and experiences to the new president and his administration, the bloggers will try to start a conversation about what it means to be young and politically active in America today. Malena Amusa, a 24-year-old writer and dancer from St. Louis sees the project as a way to preserve history as it happens. Amusa, who is traveling to India this spring to finish a book, then to Senegal to teach English, has ongoing conversations with her friends about how the Obama presidency has changed their daily lives and hopes to put some of those ideas, along with her global perspective, into her posts. She's excited because, as she puts it, \"I don't have to wait [until] 15 years from now\" to make sense of the world. \n    Henry Flores, a political-science professor at St. Mary's University, credits this younger generation's political strength to their embrace of technology. “[The Internet] exposes them to more thinking,” he says,“and groups that are like-minded in different parts of the country start to come together.” That’s exactly what the Generation O bloggers are hoping to do. The result could be a group of young people that, like their boomer (二战后生育高峰期出生的美国人) parents, grows up with a strong sense of purpose and sheds the image of apathy (冷漠) they've inherited from Generation X (60 年代后期和70 年代出生的美国人). It's no small challenge for a blog run by a group of ordinary—if ambitious—young people, but the members of Generation O are up to the task.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102965,"title":"What is the finding of a new study by CIRCLE?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的a new study by CIRCLE定位到第一段第一句。\n解析：第一段第一句today's youth vote in larger numbers than previous generations“与前辈相比，今天有更多的年轻人参与投票”，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Young people in America are now more diverse ideologically."},{"option":2,"content":"More young voters are going to the polls than before."},{"option":3,"content":"The younger generation supports traditionally liberal causes."},{"option":4,"content":"Young voters played a decisive role in Obama's election."}]},{"id":102966,"title":"What is a main concern of the writers of Generation O?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的the writers of Generation O定位到第二段第一句。\n解析：由定位句中want to answer that question“想要回答这个问题”，又看到第一段末句提及的问题will politically engaged young people continue to support the president and his agenda，可知The writers of Generation O首要关注的是年轻人是否继续支持奥巴马的政策，即A为正确选项。 ","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Whether young people will continue to support Obama's policy."},{"option":2,"content":"How Obama's agenda is going to affect the life of Americans."},{"option":3,"content":"Whether America is going to change during Obama's presidency."},{"option":4,"content":"How Obama is going to live up to young people's expectations."}]},{"id":102967,"title":"What will the Generation O bloggers write about in their posts?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的the Generation O bloggers write about in their posts定位到第二段第二句。\n解析：第二段第二句中“will blog about life across mainstream America, with one twist: by tying all of their ideas and experiences to the new president and his administration“将会用博客记录美国主流社会的生活，包括所有有关新总统和新政府的观点和个人体验” ，即A为正确选项。 ","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Their lives in relation to Obama's presidency.

Last spring one of the two, Australia, gave up the dubious distinction by establishing paid family leave starting in 2011. I wasn’t surprised when this didn't make the news here in the United States—we’re now the only wealthy country without such a policy. \n    The United States does have one explicit family policy, the Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993. It entitles workers to as much as 12 weeks’ unpaid leave for care of a newborn or dealing with a family medical problem. Despite the modesty of the benefit, the Chamber of Commerce and other business groups fought it bitterly, describing it as “government-run personnel management” and a “dangerous precedent.” In fact, every step of the way, as (usually) Democratic leaders have tried to introduce work-family balance measures into the law, business groups have been strongly opposed. \n    As Yale law professor Anne Alstott argues, justifying parental support depends on defining the family as a social good that, in some sense, society must pay for. In her book No Exit: What Parents Owe Their Children and What Society Owes Parents, she argues that parents are burdened in many ways in their lives: there is “no exit” when it comes to children. “Society expects—and needs—parents to provide their children with continuity of care, meaning the intensive, intimate care that human beings need to develop their intellectual, emotional and moral capabilities. And society expects—and needs—parents to persist in their roles for 18 years, or longer if needed. \"\n    While most parents do this out of love, there are public penalties for not providing care. What parents do, in other words, is of deep concern to the state, for the obvious reason that caring for children is not only morally urgent but essential for the future of society. The state recognizes this in the large body of family laws that govern children' welfare, yet parents receive little help in meeting the life-changing obligations society imposes. To classify parenting as a personal choice for which there is no collective responsibility is not merely to ignore the social benefits of good parenting really, it is to steal those benefits because they accrue (不断积累) to the whole of society as today’s children become tomorrow’s productive citizenry (公民). In fact, by some estimates, the value of parental investments in children, investments of time and money (including lost wages), is equal to 20-30% of gross domestic product. If these investments generate huge social benefits—as they clearly do—the benefits of providing more social support for the family should be that much clearer.

In a world struggling with rapid industrialization, science and technology seemed to offer solutions to almost every problem. Newly created state colleges and universities devoted themselves almost entirely to scientific, technological, and engineering fields. Many Americans came to believe that scientific certainty could not only solve scientific problems, but also reform politics, government, and business. Two world wars and a Great Depression rocked the confidence of many people that scientific expertise alone could create a prosperous and ordered world. After World War Ⅱ, the academic world turned with new enthusiasm to humanistic studies, which seemed to many scholars the best way to ensure the survival of democracy. American scholars fanned out across much of the world—with support from the Ford Foundation, the Fulbright program, etc.—to promote the teaching of literature and the arts in an effort to make the case for democratic freedoms.\n    In the America of our own time, the great educational challenge has become an effort to strengthen the teaching of what is now known as the STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, and math). There is considerable and justified concern that the United States is falling behind much of the rest of the developed world in these essential disciplines. India, China, Japan, and other regions seem to be seizing technological leadership.\n    At the same time, perhaps inevitably, the humanities—while still popular in elite colleges and universities—have experienced a significant decline. Humanistic disciplines are seriously underfunded, not just by the government and the foundations but by academic institutions themselves. Humanists are usually among the lowest-paid faculty members at most institutions and are often lightly regarded because they do not generate grant income and because they provide no obvious credentials (资质) for most nonacademic careers.\n    Undoubtedly American education should train more scientists and engineers. Much of the concern among politicians about the state of American universities today is focused on the absence of “real world” education—which means preparation for professional and scientific careers. But the idea that institutions or their students must decide between humanities and science is false. Our society could not survive without scientific and technological knowledge. But we would be equally impoverished (贫困的) without humanistic knowledge as well. Science and technology teach us what we can do. Humanistic thinking helps us understand what we should do.\n    It is almost impossible to imagine our society without thinking of the extraordinary achievements of scientists and engineers in building our complicated world. But try to imagine our world as well without the remarkable works that have defined our culture and values.

This is the undercurrent of conversation at Einstein memorial meetings throughout the year. A new Einstein will emerge, scientists say. But it may take a long time. After all, more than 200 years separated Einstein from his nearest rival, Isaac Newton.\n    Many physicists say the next Einstein hasn’t been born yet, or is a baby now. That’s because the quest for a unified theory that would account for all the forces of nature has pushed current mathematics to its limits. New math must be created before the problem can be solved.\n    But researchers say there are many other factors working against another Einstein emerging anytime soon.\n    For one thing, physics is a much different field today. In Einstein’s day, there were only a few thousand physicists worldwide, and the theoreticians who could intellectually rival Einstein probably would fit into a streetcar with seats to spare.\n    Education is different, too. One crucial aspect of Einstein’s training that is overlooked is the years of philosophy he read as a teenager—Kant, Schopenhauer and Spinoza, among others. It taught him how to think independently and abstractly about space and time, and it wasn’t long before he became a philosopher himself.\n    “The independence created by philosophical insight is—in my opinion—the mark of distinction between a mere artisan (工匠) or specialist and a real seeker after truth,” Einstein wrote in 1944.\n    And he was an accomplished musician. The interplay between music and math is well known. Einstein would furiously play his violin as a way to think through a knotty physics problem.\n    Today, universities have produced millions of physicists. There aren’t many jobs in science for them, so they go to Wall Street and Silicon Valley to apply their analytical skills to more practical—and rewarding—efforts.\n    “Maybe there is an Einstein out there today,” said Columbia University physicist Brian Greene, “but it would be a lot harder for him to be heard.”\n    Especially considering what Einstein was proposing.\n    “The actual fabric of space and time curving? My God, what an idea!” Greene said at a recent gathering at the Aspen Institute. “It takes a certain type of person who will bang his head against the wall because you believe you’ll find the solution.”\n    Perhaps the best examples are the five scientific papers Einstein wrote in his “miracle year” of 1905. These “thought experiments” were pages of calculations signed and submitted to the prestigious journal Annalen der Physik by a virtual unknown. There were no footnotes or citations.\n    What might happen to such a submission today?\n    “We all get papers like those in the mail,” Greene said. “We put them in the junk file.”","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102980,"title":"What do scientists seem to agree upon, judging from the first two paragraphs?","textExplain":"定位：据题干信息定位于第一二段。\n解析：根据第一段的3,4句，A new Einstein will emerge, scientists say.

The American public overwhelmingly thinks they're bad. Yet the consensus among most economists is that immigration, both legal and illegal, provides a small net boost to the economy. Immigrants provide cheap labor, lower the prices of everything from farm produce to new homes, and leave consumers with a little more money in their pockets. So why is there such a discrepancy between the perception of immigrants' impact on the economy and the reality?\n    There are a number of familiar theories. Some argue that people are anxious and feel threatened by an inflow of new workers. Others highlight the strain that undocumented immigrants place on public services, like schools, hospitals, and jails. Still others emphasize the role of race, arguing that foreigners add to the nation's fears and insecurities. There's some truth to all these explanations, but they aren't quite sufficient.\n    To get a better understanding of what's going on, consider the way immigration's impact is felt. Though its overall effect may be positive, its costs and benefits are distributed unevenly. David Card, an economist at UC Berkeley, notes that the ones who profit most directly from immigrants' low-cost labor are businesses and employers—meatpacking plants in Nebraska, for instance, or agricultural businesses in California. Granted, these producers' savings probably translate into lower prices at the grocery store, but how many consumers make that mental connection at the checkout counter? As for the drawbacks of illegal immigration, these, too, are concentrated. Native low-skilled workers suffer most from the competition of foreign labor. According to a study by George Borjas, a Harvard economist, immigration reduced the wages of American high-school dropouts by 9% between 1980-2000.\n    Among high-skilled, better-educated employees, however, opposition was strongest in states with both high numbers of immigrants and relatively generous social services. What worried them most, in other words, was the fiscal (财政的)burden of immigration.

In it the majority of students will have conformed to the standard model of the time: male, middle class and Western. Walk into a class today, however, and you'll get a completely different impression. For a start, you will now see plenty more women the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, for example, boasts that 40% of its new enrollment is female. You will also see a wide range of ethnic groups and nationals of practically every country.\n    It might be tempting, therefore, to think that the old barriers have been broken down and equal opportunity achieved. But, increasingly this apparent diversity is becoming a mask for a new type of conformity. Behind the differences in sex, skin tones and mother tongues, there are common attitudes, expectations and ambitions which risk creating a set of clones among the business leaders of the future.\n    Diversity, it seems, has not helped to address fundamental weaknesses in business leadership. So what can be done to create more effective managers of the commercial world? According to Valerie Gauthier, associate dean at HEC Paris, the key lies in the process by which MBA programmers recruit their students. At the moment candidates are selected on a fairly narrow set of criteria such as prior academic and career performance, and analytical and problem solving abilities. This is then coupled to a school's picture of what a diverse class should look like, with the result that passport, ethnic origin and sex can all become influencing factors. But schools rarely dig down to find out what really makes an applicant succeed, to create a class which also contains diversity of attitude and approach arguably the only diversity that, in a business context, really matters.\n    Professor Gauthier believes schools should not just be selecting candidates from traditional sectors such as banking, consultancy and industry. They should also be seeking individuals who have backgrounds in areas such as political science, the creative arts, history or philosophy, which will allow them to put business decisions into a wider context.\n    Indeed, there does seem to be a demand for the more rounded leaders such diversity might create. A study by Mannaz, a leadership development company, suggests that, while the bully-boy chief executive of old may not have been eradicated completely, there is a definite shift in emphasis towards less tough styles of management—at least in America and Europe. Perhaps most significant, according to Mannaz, is the increasing interest large companies have in more collaborative management models, such as those prevalent in Scandinavia, which seek to integrate the hard and soft aspects of leadership and encourage delegated responsibility and accountability.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102990,"title":"What characterizes the business school student population of today?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的business school student of today将本题定位于第一段。\n解析：第一段说的是今天的商科学校与20年前相比，学生的构成发生了彻底的改变。第一段第四句话中boasts that 40% of its new enrollment is female，“骄傲地说40%的生源是女生”。最后一句话You will also see a wide range of ethnic groups and nationals of practically every country，“你也会看到几乎所有国家的不同民族的人”。即女性比例增加了，而且民族也更加多样化了。即A选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Greater diversity."},{"option":2,"content":"Intellectual maturity."},{"option":3,"content":"Exceptional diligence."},{"option":4,"content":"Higher ambition."}]},{"id":102991,"title":"What is the author's concern about current business school education?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的author's concern 和current business school education将本题定位于第二段最后一句。\n解析：定位句说，Behind the differences in sex, skin tones and mother tongues, there are common attitudes, expectations and ambitions which risk creating a set of clones among the business leaders of the future，“在性别、肤色和母语差异的背后，存在很多相同的态度、期望和抱负，这些都在为未来商业领袖中创造出一批毫无特性的克隆人埋下隐患”。即现在的商学教育输出的是毫无个性的人，故B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It will arouse students' unrealistic expectations."},{"option":2,"content":"It will produce business leaders of a uniform style."},{"option":3,"content":"It focuses on theory rather than on practical skills."},{"option":4,"content":"It stresses competition rather than cooperation."}]},{"id":102992,"title":"What aspect of diversity does Valerie Gauthier think is most important?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的Valerie Gauthier将本题定位于原文第三段第一句到该段结束。\n解析；该段全段都是Valerie Gauthier的观点。最后一句说很少有学校能够深挖一个人成功的真正原因，也很少有学校去创造能够容纳态度和方法多样性的课堂，而这种多样性正是商业环境中真正重要的。即Valerie Gauthier认为态度和方法的多样性最为重要，故C选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Age and educational background."},{"option":2,"content":"Social and professional experience."},{"option":3,"content":"Attitude and approach to business."},{"option":4,"content":"Ethnic origin and gender."}]},{"id":102993,"title":"What applicants does the author think MBA programmers should consider recruiting?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的applicants将本题定位于文章第四段第一句（candidates）。\n解析：定位句后面一句说，They should also be seeking individuals who have backgrounds in areas such as political science, the creative arts, history or philosophy, which will allow them to put business decisions into a wider context，“学校还应该将那些有政治学、创造性艺术、历史或哲学等领域背景的人吸纳进来”。即商科学校应该引入其它教育背景的人才，故C选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Applicants with prior experience in business companies."},{"option":2,"content":"Applicants with sound knowledge in math and statistics."},{"option":3,"content":"Applicants from outside the traditional sectors."},{"option":4,"content":"Applicants from less developed regions and areas."}]},{"id":102994,"title":"What does Mannaz say about the current management style?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的Mannaz和the current management style将本题定位于最后一段第二、三句。\n解析：由定位句可知，Mannaz公司认为，there is a definite shift in emphasis towards less tough styles of management，“管理方式确实向着更加宽松的方式转变”。后面一句说Perhaps most significant, according to Mannaz, is the increasing interest large companies have in more collaborative management models，“最重要的是大型企业对协作化的管理模式的兴趣不断增加”，即管理方式变得更加协作化，故正确选项为D。 ","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is eradicating the tough aspects of management."},{"option":2,"content":"It encourages male and female executives to work side by side."},{"option":3,"content":"It adopts the bully-boy chief executive model."},{"option":4,"content":"It is shifting towards more collaborative models."}]}]},{"id":4986,"name":"2011.12 Passage One","content":"    What's the one word of advice a well-meaning professional would give to a recent college graduate? China? India? Brazil? How about trade?\n    When the Commerce Department reported last week that the trade deficit in June approached $50 billion, it set off a new round of economic doomsaying. Imports, which soared to $200.3 billion in the month, are subtracted in the calculation of gross domestic product. The larger the trade deficit, the smaller the GDP. Should such imbalances continue, pessimists say, they could contribute to slower growth.\n    But there's another way of looking at the trade data. Over the past two years, the figures on imports and exports seem not to signal a double-dip recession – a renewed decline in the broad level of economic activity in the United States – but an economic expansion.\n    The rising volume of trade – more goods and services shuttling in and out of the United States – is good news for many sectors. Companies engaged in shipping, trucking, rail freight, delivery, and logistics (物流) have all been reporting better than expected results. The rising numbers signify growing vitality in foreign markets – when we import more stuff, it puts more cash in the hands of people around the world, and U.S. exports are rising because more foreigners have the ability to buy the things we produce and market. The rising tide of trade is also good news for people who work in trade-sensitive businesses, especially those that produce commodities for which global demand sets the price – agricultural goods, mining, metals, oil.\n    And while exports always seem to lag, U.S. companies are becoming more involved in the global economy with each passing month. General Motors sells as many cars in China as in America each month. While that may not do much for imports, it does help GM's balance sheet – and hence makes the jobs of U.S.-based executives more stable.\n    One great challenge for the U.S. economy is slack domestic consumer demand. Americans are paying down debt, saving more, and spending more carefully. That's to be expected, given what we've been through. But there's a bigger challenge. Can U.S.-based businesses, large and small, figure out how to get a piece of growing global demand? Unless you want to pick up and move to India, or Brazil, or China, the best way to do that is through trade. It may seem obvious, but it's no longer enough simply to do business with our friends and neighbors here at home.\n    Companies and individuals who don't have a strategy to export more, or to get more involved in foreign markets, or to play a role in global trade, are shutting themselves out of the lion's share of economic opportunity in our world.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102995,"title":"How do pessimists interpret the U.S. trade deficit in June?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的pessimists定位到原文第二段最后一句。\n解析：定位句说Should such imbalances continue, pessimists say, they could contribute to slower growth，“悲观主义者说，如果不平衡持续下去，就会导致增涨变缓”。即悲观主义者认为美国的贸易逆差会导致经济放缓，故正确选项为C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is the result of America's growing focus on domestic market."},{"option":2,"content":"It signifies a change in American economic structure."},{"option":3,"content":"It could lead to slower growth of the national economy."},{"option":4,"content":"It reflects Americans' preference for imported goods."}]},{"id":102996,"title":"What does the author say about the trade data of the past two years?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的trade data of the past two years定位到第三段第一句和第二句。\n解析：定位句But there's another way of looking at the trade data.

We should take this concern seriously as universities are key in the national innovation system.\n    However, we do have to challenge the unthinking complaint that the sector does not do enough in taking ideas to market. The most recent comparative data on the performance of universities and research institutions in Australia, Canada, USA and UK shows that, from a relatively weak starting position, the UK now leads on many indicators of commercialisation activity.\n    When viewed at the national level, the policy interventions of the past decade have helped transform the performance of UK universities. Evidence suggests the UK's position is much stronger than in the recent past and is still showing improvement. But national data masks the very large variation in the performance of individual universities. The evidence shows that a large number of universities have fallen off the back of the pack, a few perform strongly and the rest chase the leaders.\n    This type of uneven distribution is not peculiar to the UK and is mirrored across other economies. In the UK, research is concentrated: less than 25% of universities receive 75% of the research funding. These same universities are also the institutions producing the greatest share of PhD graduates, science citations, patents and license income. The effect of policies generating long-term resource concentration has also created a distinctive set of universities which are research-led and commercially active. It seems clear that the concentration of research and commercialization work creates differences between universities.\n    The core objective for universities which are research-led must be to maximise the impact of their research efforts. These universities should be generating the widest range of social, economic and environmental benefits. In return for the scale of investment, they should share their expertise in order to build greater confidence in the sector.\n    Part of the economic recovery of the UK will be driven by the next generation of research commercialization spilling out of our universities. There are three dozen universities in the UK which are actively engaged in advanced research training and commercialization work.\n    If there was a greater coordination of technology transfer offices within regions and a simultaneous investment in the scale and functions of our graduate schools, universities could, and should, play a key role in positioning the UK for the next growth cycle.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103000,"title":"What does the author think of UK universities in terms of commercialization?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的UK universities 和 commercialisation 定位至第三段第二句。\n解析：定位句中the UK now leads on many indicators of commercialisation activity，“英国在许多商业活动指标上都出于领先地位”。即英国的大学在（知识）商业化方面仍处于领先集团，即D选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They have lost their leading position in many ways."},{"option":2,"content":"They do not regard it as their responsibility."},{"option":3,"content":"They fail to convert knowledge into money."},{"option":4,"content":"They still have a place among the world leaders."}]},{"id":103001,"title":"What does the author say about the national data on UK universities' performance in commercialization?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的UK universities' performance定位至第四段第一句。\n解析：第四段第一句说过去十年的政策干预对英国大学的表现产生了积极地影响。第三句出现关键转折，But national data masks the very large variation in the performance of individual universities，“但是全国性的数据掩盖了单个大学之间的巨大差异”，即没有反应出单个大学的不同表现，故A选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It does not reflect the differences among universities."},{"option":2,"content":"It masks the fatal weaknesses of government policy."},{"option":3,"content":"It does not rank UK universities in a scientific way."},{"option":4,"content":"It indicates their ineffective use of government resources."}]},{"id":103002,"title":"We can infer from Paragraph 5 that \"policy interventions\" (Line 1, Para. 4) refers to _____.","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的Paragraph 5和policy interventions定位到第五段的第二句。\n解析：定位句说，In the UK, research is concentrated: less than 25% of universities receive 75% of the research funding，“英国存在着研究集中化的情况，即不到25%的大学获得了75%的研究经费”，即资源集中在少数学校上，故C选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"fair distribution of funding for universities and research institutions"},{"option":2,"content":"compulsory cooperation between universities and industries"},{"option":3,"content":"concentration of resources in a limited number of universities"},{"option":4,"content":"government aid to non-research-oriented universities"}]},{"id":103003,"title":"What does the author suggest research-led universities do?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的research-led university定位至第六段第一、二句。\n解析：第六段第一句，The core objective for universities which are research-led must be to maximise the impact of their research efforts，“研究主导型大学必须以其研究成果影响最大化作为其核心目标”。第二句说These universities should be generating the widest range of social, economic and environmental benefits，“这些大学应该生产出最广泛的社会、经济和环境利益”。即作者认为研究型主导大学应该使其所作研究效益最大化，故B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Generously share their facilities with those short of funds."},{"option":2,"content":"Fully utilise their research to benefit all sectors of society."},{"option":3,"content":"Spread their influence among top research institutions."},{"option":4,"content":"Publicise their research to win international recognition."}]},{"id":103004,"title":"How can the university sector play a key role in the UK's economic growth?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的play a key role 定位至最后一段。\n解析：最后一段说，If there was a greater coordination of technology transfer offices within regions and a simultaneous investment in the scale and functions of our graduate schools, universities could, and should, play a key role in positioning the UK for the next growth cycle，“如果地区间的技术转移部门的协调更加顺畅，并同时对研究生院进行投入使其规模和功能增强，大学就会在下一轮经济增长中发挥重要作用”，即英国的经济增长需要技术部门的协调和对研究生院校进行投入，故C选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"By increasing the efficiency of technology transfer agencies."},{"option":2,"content":"By establishing more regional technology transfer offices."},{"option":3,"content":"By promoting technology transfer and graduate school education."},{"option":4,"content":"By asking the government to invest in technology transfer research."}]}]},{"id":4996,"name":"2012.6 Passage One","content":"    As anyone who has tried to lose weight knows, realistic goal-setting generally produces the best results. That's partially because it appears people who set realistic goals actually work more efficiently, and exert more effort, to achieve those goals.\n    What's far less understood by scientists, however, are the potentially harmful effects of goal-setting.\n　Newspapers relay daily accounts of goal-setting prevalent in industries and businesses up and down both Wall Street and Main Street , yet there has been surprisingly little research on how the long-trumpeted practice of setting goals may have contributed to the current economic crisis , and unethical (不道德的)behavior in general.\n　“ Goals are widely used and promoted as having really beneficial effects. And yet, the same motivation that can push people to exert more effort in a constructive way could also motivate people to be more likely to engage in unethical behaviors,” says Maurice Schweitzer, an associate professor at Penn’s Wharton School.\n　\" It turns out there’s no economic benefit to just having a goal—you just get a psychological benefit,” Schweitzer says. “ But in many cases, goals have economic rewards that make them more powerful.”\n　A prime example Schweitzer and his colleagues cite is the 2004 collapse of energy-trading giant Enron, where managers used financial incentives to motivate salesmen to meet specific revenue goals. The problem, Schweitzer says, is the actual trades were not profitable.\n　Other studies have shown that saddling employees with unrealistic goals can compel them to lie, cheat or steal. Such was the case in the early 1990s when Sears imposed a sales quota on its auto repair staff. It prompted employees to overcharge for work and to complete unnecessary repairs on a companywide basis.\n　Schweitzer concedes his research runs counter to a very large body of literature that commends the many benefits of goal-setting.

Now the question must be reversed: what can the West’s overly indebted and sluggish (经济滞长的) nations learn from a flourishing Asia?\n　Just a few decades ago, Asia’s two giants were stagnating(停滞不前) under faulty economic ideologies. However, once China began embracing free-market reforms in the 1980s, followed by India in the 1990s, both countries achieved rapid growth. Crucially, as they opened up their markets, they balanced market economy with sensible government direction. As the Indian economist Amartya Sen has wisely said, “The invisible hand of the market has often relied heavily on the visible hand of government.”\n　Contrast this middle path with America and Europe, which have each gone ideologically overboard in their own ways. Since the 1980s, America has been increasingly clinging to the ideology of uncontrolled free markets and dismissing the role of government—following Ronald Regan’s idea that “government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. “Of course, when the markets came crashing down in 2007, it was decisive government intervention that saved the day. Despite this fact, many Americans are still strongly opposed to “ big government.”\n    If Americans could only free themselves from their antigovernment doctrine, they would begin to see that the America’s problems are not insoluble. A few sensible federal measures could put the country back on the right path. A simple consumption tax of, say, 5% would significantly reduce the country’s huge government deficit without damaging productivity. A small gasoline tax would help free America from its dependence on oil imports and create incentives for green energy development. In the same way, a significant reduction of wasteful agricultural subsidies could also lower the deficit. But in order to take advantage of these common-sense solutions, Americans will have to put aside their own attachment to the idea of smaller government and less regulation. American politicians will have to develop the courage to follow what is taught in all American public-policy schools: that there are good taxes and bad taxes. Asian countries have embraced this wisdom, and have built sound long-term fiscal (财政的) policies as a result.\n    Meanwhile, Europe has fallen prey to a different ideological trap: the belief that European governments would always have infinite resources and could continue borrowing as if there were no tomorrow. Unlike the Americans, who felt that the markets knew best, the Europeans failed to anticipate how the markets would react to their endless borrowing. Today, the European Union is creating a $580 billion fund to ward off sovereign collapse. This will buy the EU time, but it will not solve the bloc’s larger problem.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103010,"title":"What has contributed to the rapid economic growth in China and India?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中growth in China and India定位到第二段第二、三句话。.\n解析：定位句说，However, once China began embracing free-market reforms in the 1980s, followed by India in the 1990s, both countries achieved rapid growth. “中国在20世纪80年代开始推行自由市场改革，印度在90年代紧跟其后，两国均实现了快速的增长”。后面一句说，Crucially, as they opened up their markets, they balanced market economy with sensible government direction，“至关重要的是，随着市场的开放，他们在市场经济和政府导向之间取得了平衡”。即市场经济和政府调控是中印经济快速发展的原因，故D选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Timely reform of government at all levels."},{"option":2,"content":"Heavy reliance on the hand of government."},{"option":3,"content":"Copying western-style economic behavior."},{"option":4,"content":"Free market plus government intervention."}]},{"id":103011,"title":"What does Ronald Reagan mean by saying “government is the problem” (line4, Para. 3)?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中Ronald Reagan定位到第三段第二句话。\n解析：定位句说，Since the 1980s, America has been increasingly clinging to the ideology of uncontrolled free markets and dismissing the role of government—following Ronald Regan’s idea that “government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem，“可知20世纪80年代以来，美国从上世纪80年代已经越来越迷恋于无约束的自由市场思维，李根总统说政府不能解决问题，政府本身就是个问题”。由此可知，美国人认为政府会阻碍经济发展，即B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Government action is key to solving economic problems."},{"option":2,"content":"Government regulation hinders economic development."},{"option":3,"content":"Many social ills are caused by wrong government policies."},{"option":4,"content":"Many social problems arise from government’s inefficiency."}]},{"id":103012,"title":"What stopped the American economy from collapsing in 2007?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中2007定位到第三段第三句话\n解析：定位句说，when the markets came crashing down in 2007, it was decisive government intervention that saved the day，“当市场经济在2007年轰然崩溃时，正是果断的政府干预扭转了局面”，故B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Abandonment of big government by the public."},{"option":2,"content":"Effective measures adopted by the government."},{"option":3,"content":"Self-regulatory repair mechanisms of the free market."},{"option":4,"content":"Cooperation between the government and businesses."}]},{"id":103013,"title":"What is the author’s suggestion to the American public in face of the public government deficit?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中suggestion to the American public和deficit定位到第四段倒数第三句话。\n解析：定位句说，But in order to take advantage of these common-sense solutions, Americans will have to put aside their own attachment to the idea of smaller government and less regulation，“要利用这些常识性的解决方案，美国人必须要把自己对更小政府、更少调控这种想法的笃信放到一边”，即D选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They develop green energy to avoid dependence on oil import."},{"option":2,"content":"They urge the government to revise its existing public policies."},{"option":3,"content":"They put up with the inevitable sharp increase of different taxes."},{"option":4,"content":"They give up the idea of smaller government and less regulation."}]},{"id":103014,"title":"What’s the problem with the European Union?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中European Union定位到第五段第一句话。\n解析：定位句说，Europe has fallen prey to a different ideological trap: the belief that European governments would always have infinite resources and could continue borrowing as if there were no tomorrow，“欧洲落入了另一个意识形态陷阱：相信欧洲各国政府总有无限的资源，能像没有明天一样持续借贷”。可见，欧盟的问题在于借贷过多，即D选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Conservative ideology."},{"option":2,"content":"Shrinking market."},{"option":3,"content":"Lack of resources."},{"option":4,"content":"Excessive borrowing."}]}]},{"id":5006,"name":"2012.12 (Passage One 卷一)","content":"    Amid all the job losses, there’s one category of worker that the economic disruption has been good for: nonhumans.\n    From self-service checkout lines at the supermarket to industrial robots armed with saws and taught to carve up animal bodies in slaughter-houses, these ever-more-intelligent machines are now not just assisting workers but actually kicking them out of their jobs.\n    Automation isn’t just affecting factory workers, either. Some law firms now use artificial intelligence software to scan and read mountains of legal documents, work that previously was performed by highly-paid human lawyers.\n    “Robots continue to have an impact on blue-collar jobs, and white-collar jobs are under attack by microprocessors,” says economics professor Edward Leamer. The recession permanently wiped out 2.5 million jobs. U.S. gross domestic product has climbed back to pre-recession levels, meaning we’re producing as much as before, only with 6% fewer workers. To be sure, robotics are not the only job killers out there, with outsourcing (外包) stealing far more jobs than automation.\n    Jeff Burnstein, president of the Robotics Industry Association, argues that robots actually save U.S. jobs. His logic: companies that embrace automation might use fewer workers, but that’s still better than firing everyone and moving the work overseas.\n    It’s not that robots are cheaper than humans, though often they are. It’s that they’re better. “In some cases the quality requirements are so exacting that even if you wanted to have a human do the job, you couldn’t,” Burnstein says.\n    Same goes for surgeons, who’re using robotic systems to perform an ever-growing list of operations—not because the machines save money but because, thanks to the greater precision of robots, the patients recover in less time and have fewer complications, says Dr. Myriam Curet.\n    Surgeons may survive the robot invasion, but others at the hospital might not be so lucky, as iRobot, maker of the Roomba, a robot vacuum cleaner, has been showing off Ava, which could be used as a messenger in a hospital. And once you’re home, recovering, Ava could let you talk to your doctor, so there’s no need to send someone to your house. That “mobile telepresence” could be useful at the office. If you’re away on a trip, you can still attend a meeting. Just connect via videoconferencing software, so your face appears on Ava’s screen.\n    Is any job safe? I was hoping to say “journalist,” but researchers are already developing software that can gather facts and write a news story, which means that a few years from now, a robot could be writing this column.

President Obama will no doubt make the point publicly when he gets to Beijing: the Chinese need to consume more; they need—believe it or not—to become more like Americans, for the sake of the global economy.\n    And it’s all true. But the other side of that equation is that the U.S. needs to save more. For the moment, American households actually are doing so. After the personal-savings rate dipped to zero in 2005, the shock of the economic crisis last year prompted people to snap shut their wallets.\n    In China, the household-savings rate exceeds 20%. It is partly for policy reasons. As we’ve seen, wage earners are expected to care for not only their children but their aging parents. And there is, to date, only the flimsiest (脆弱的) of publicly-funded health care and pension systems, which increases incentives for individuals to save while they are working. But China is a society that has long esteemed personal financial prudence (谨慎). There is no chance that will change anytime soon, even if the government creates a better social safety net and successfully encourages greater consumer spending.\n    Why does the U.S. need to learn a little frugality (节俭)？Because healthy savings rates are one of the surest indicators of a country’s long-term financial health. High savings lead, over time, to increased investment, which in turn generates productivity gains, innovation and job growth. In short, savings are the seed corn of a good economic harvest.\n    The U.S. government thus needs to act as well. By running constant deficits, it is dis-saving, even as households save more. Peter Orszag, Obama’s Budget Director, recently called the U.S. budget deficits unsustainable and he’s right. To date, the U.S. has seemed unable to see the consequences of spending so much more than is taken in. That needs to change. And though Hu Jintao and the rest of the Chinese leadership aren’t inclined to lecture visiting Presidents, he might gently hint that Beijing is getting a little nervous about the value of the dollar—which has fallen 15% since March, in large part because of increasing fears that America’s debt load is becoming unmanageable.\n    That’s what happens when you’re the world’s biggest creditor: you get to drop hints like that, which would be enough by themselves to create international economic chaos if they were ever leaked. (Every time any official in Beijing deliberates publicly about seeking an alternative to the U.S. dollar for the $2.1 trillion China holds in reserve, currency traders have a heart attack.)

That’s  a question hard to answer. Hard because there’s no conclusive definition of poverty. Low income matters, though how low is unclear. Poverty is also a state of mind that fosters self-defeating behavior—bad work habits, family breakdowns, and additions. Finally, poverty results from bad luck: accidents, job losses, disability.\n    Despite poverty’s messiness, we’ve measured progress against it by a single statics: the federal poverty line. By this measure, we haven’t made much progress. But the apparent lack of progress is misleading for two reasons.\n    First, it ignores immigration. Many immigrants are poor and low skilled. They add to the poor. From 1989 to 2007, about three quarters of the increase in the poverty population occurred among Hispanics(西班牙裔美国人)—mostly immigrants and their children.\n    Second, the poor’s material well-being has improved. The official poverty measure obscures this by counting only pre-tax cash income and ignoring other sources of support, including food stamps and housing subsidies. Although many poor live from hand to mouth, they’ve participated in rising living standards. In 2005, 91% had microwaves, 79% air-conditioning, and 48% cell phones.\n    The existing poverty line could be improved by adding some income resource and subtracting some expenses. Unfortunately, the administration’s proposal for a “supplemental poverty measures” in 2011 goes beyond that. The new poverty number would compound public confusion. It also raises questions about whether the statics is tailored to favor a political agenda.\n    The “supplemental measures” ties the poverty threshold to what the poorest third of Americans spend on food, housing, clothing, and utilities. The actual threshold will probably be higher than today’s poverty line. Many Americans would find this weird: people get richer, but “poverty”stays stuck.\n    What produces this outcome is a different view of poverty. The present concept is an absolute one: the poverty threshold reflects the amount estimated to meet basic needs. By contrast, the new measure embraces a relative notion of poverty: people are automatically poor if they’re given distance from the top, even if their income are increasing.\n    The new indicator is a “propaganda device” to promote income redistribution by showing that poverty is stubborn or increasing. The Census Bureau has estimated statics similar to the administration’s proposal. In 2008, the traditional poverty rate was 13.2%; estimates of the new statics range up to 17%. The new poverty statistic exceeds the old, and the gap grows larger over time.\n    As senator Daniel Moynihan said, the administration is defining poverty up.

Along with lectures on finance and entrepreneurship and the like, the program included a delightfully out-of-place session with AL Filreis, an English professor at the University of Pennsylvania, on poetry.\n    For three hours he talked us through “The Red Wheelbarrow” and “Stopping by Woods on a Showy Evening”. The experience——especially when contrasted with the horrible prose of our other assigned reading——sent me fleeing to the campus bookstore, where I resumed a long-interrupted romance with meter and rhyme.\n    Professor Filreis says that he is “a little shock” at how intensely his Wharton students respond to this unexpected deviation from the business, not just as a relief but as a kind of stimulus. Many write afterward asking him to recommend books of poetry. Especially now.\n    “The grim economy seems to make the participants keener than ever to think ‘out of the box’ in the way poetry encourages,” he told me.\n     Which brings me to Congress, an institution stuck deeper inside the box than just about any other these days. You have probably heard that up on Capital Hill, they’re very big on prayer breakfast, where members gather over scrambled eggs and ask God for wisdom. Well, maybe it’s time to add some poetry readings to the agenda.\n     I’m not suggesting that poetry will guide our legislators to wisdom any more than prayer has. Just that it might make them a little more human. Poetry is no substitute for courage or competence, but properly applied, it is a challenge to self-certainty, which we currently have in excess. Poetry serves as a spur to creative thinking, a reproach to dogma and habit, a remedy to the current fashion for pledge signing.\n    The poet Shelley, in defense of poetry nearly two centuries ago, wrote, “A man, to be greatly good, must imagine intensely and comprehensively; he must put himself in the place of another and of many others; the pains and pleasures of his species must become his own.” Shelley concludes that essay by calling poets “the unacknowledged legislators of the world,” because they bring imagination to the realm of “reasoners and mechanists.”\n    The relevance of poetry was declared more concisely in five lines from the love poem “Asphodel, That Greeny Flower,” by William Carlos William:\n   It is difficult\n   to get the news from poems\n   yet men die miserably every day\n   for lack\n   of what is found there.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103030,"title":"Why did the author participate in the Wharton School management program?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的Wharton School management program定位到文章首段第一句。\n解析：定位句说I was sent to a management program at the Wharton School to be prepared for bigger things，“为了给更加重要的事情做准备，我参加沃顿商学院参加管理培训项目”。即作者去沃顿商学院接受培训是为了更加重要的工作岗位，故B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He was a passionate lover of classical poetry."},{"option":2,"content":"He was being trained for an important position."},{"option":3,"content":"He had just been promoted to top management."},{"option":4,"content":"He was interested in finance and entrepreneurship."}]},{"id":103031,"title":"What did the author think of Professor Filreis’s poetry session?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的Professor Filreis’s poetry session定位到文章第一段最后一句和第二段。\n解析：第一段最后一句提到Professor Filreis的诗歌课，第二段作者说该教授的诗歌课让作者重温了对诗歌的喜爱，说明作者很喜欢教授的诗歌课；第三段第一句借教授的话说学生们对这门课的反应都很热烈。可知作者认为教授的课对学生很有吸引力，即C选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It diverted students’ attention from the assigned reading."},{"option":2,"content":"It made the management program appear romantic."},{"option":3,"content":"It was extremely appealing to the students."},{"option":4,"content":"It pulled students out of prose reading sessions."}]},{"id":103032,"title":"What was the impact of the poetry session on the program participants according to Professor Filreis?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中的participant定位到文章第四段。\n解析：定位段中The grim economy seems to make the participants keener than ever to think ‘out of the box’ in the way poetry encourages，“惨淡的经济使得学员们渴望打破固定的思维模式，以诗歌的方式进行思考”。也就是说诗歌鼓励学员们从更广阔的角度思考问题，故A选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It inspired them to view things from broader perspectives."},{"option":2,"content":"It led them to think poetry indispensable to management."},{"option":3,"content":"It helped them develop a keener interest in literate."},{"option":4,"content":"It encouraged them to embark on a political career."}]},{"id":103033,"title":"What  does the author  think of Capital Hill’s prayer over breakfast?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的prayer over breakfast定位到文章第五段。\n解析：定位段中，作者说国会比其它任何机构都深陷在固定的思维模式中，这里的人看重早餐时的祈祷，希望从上帝那里得到智慧以解决问题，也许他们应该把阅读诗歌列入日程。作者用讽刺的语言表示国会的人的早餐祷告其实对经济问题毫无帮助，即B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is a ritual that has lost its original meaning."},{"option":2,"content":"It doesn’t really help solve the economic problems."},{"option":3,"content":"It provides inspiration as poetry reading does."},{"option":4,"content":"It helps people turn away from the debt spectacle."}]},{"id":103034,"title":"What do we learn from Shelley’s essay?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的Shelley定位到文章第七段。\n解析：第七段作者引用雪莱的诗，A man, to be greatly good, must imagine intensely and comprehensively; he must put himself in the place of another and of many others; the pains and pleasures of his species must become his own，“一个真正伟大的人，必须具备强大的想象力和理解力，必须能够体会别人的苦乐”。也就是强调想象力和同理心的都是十分重要的，故D选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Poetry can relieve people of pains and sufferings."},{"option":2,"content":"It takes poetic imagination to become a legislator."},{"option":3,"content":"Legislators should win public acknowledgment."},{"option":4,"content":"It is important to be imaginative and sympathetic."}]}]}]}
