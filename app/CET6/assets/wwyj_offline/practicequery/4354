What kind of topics does your program cover?\nM: [19]Well, there are essentially domestic stories. We don’t cover international stories. We don’t cover party politics or economics. We do issues of general social concern to our British audience. They can be anything from the future of the health service to the way the environment is going downhill.\nW: How do you choose the topic? [20]Do you choose one because it’s what the public wants to know about orbecause it’s what you feel the public ought to know about?\nM: I think it’s a mixture of both. Sometimes you have a strong feeling that something is important and you want to see it examined and you want to contribute to a public debate. Sometimes people come to you with things they are worried about and they can be quite small things. They can be a story about corruption in local government, something they can’t quite understand, why it doesn’t seem to be working out properly, like they are not having their litter collected properly, or the dustbins emptied.\nW: How do you know that you’ve got a really successful program? One that is just right for the time?\nM: [21]I think you get a sense about it after working in it in a number of years. You know which stories are going to get the attention. They are going to be published just the point when the public are concerned about that.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/200906/20096C1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102599,"title":"What kind of topics does Public Eye cover?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词essentially后面domestic stories“国内事务”，与B选项Domestic issues“国内问题”构成同义替换。Public Eye的话题主要是国内事务，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Current trends in economic development."},{"option":2,"content":"Domestic issues of general social concern."},{"option":3,"content":"Stories about Britain’s relations with other nations."},{"option":4,"content":"Conflicts and compromises among political parties."}]},{"id":102600,"title":"How does Public Eye choose its topics?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词because后面the public wants to know… the public ought to know“公众想知道的还是公众应该知道的”，a mixture of both“两者都有”，与D选项public expectations and editors’ judgment“公众的期望和编辑的判断”构成同义替换。Public Eye选择话题时既考虑公众的期望，也要有编辑的判断，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Based on the polls of public opinions."},{"option":2,"content":"By interviewing people who file complaints."},{"option":3,"content":"By analysing the domestic and international situation."},{"option":4,"content":"Based on public expectations and editors’ judgment."}]},{"id":102601,"title":"What factor plays an important role in running a successful program?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n对话结尾处working in it in a number of years“在这个岗位上工作几年”，与B选项Practical experience“实践经验”构成同义替换。经营一个成功的栏目的重点是实践经验，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Underlying rules of editing."},{"option":2,"content":"Practical experience."},{"option":3,"content":"Audience’s feedback."},{"option":4,"content":"Professional qualifications."}]}]},{"id":4594,"name":"2009.6 Conversation Two","content":"W: Hi, Professor Smith. I hear you’ve written a book titled Visions.\nM: Yes. It explains how science will revolutionize the 21st century.\nW: Could I ask you some questions concerning the book?\nM: Sure.\nW: Are you optimistic about the future?\nM: Generally, yeah. [22]If we go back to the year of 1900,  most Americans didn’t live beyond the age of 50. Since then, we’ve had improvements in health care and technology. There is no reason why these won’t continue far into the 21st century.\nW: Are we ready for the changes that will come?\nM: Changes are already happening. The future is here now. We have DNA, microchips, the internet. Some people’s reaction is to say, we are too old; we don’t understand new technology. [23]My reaction is to say, we must educate people to use new technology now.\nW: Is world population going to be a big problem?\nM: Yes, and no. [24]I think that world population will stop increasing as we all get  richer . If you are a part of the middle class, you don’t want or need 12 children.\nW: Will there be a world government?\nM: Very probably. We will have to manage the world and its resources on a global level because countries alone are too small.\nW: Will we have control of everything?\nM:I think we’ll learn to control the weather, volcanoes and earthquakes. Illness won’t exist. We’ll grow new livers, kidneys, hearts, and lungs like spare parts for a car. People will live to about 130 or 150. For 2000 years, we have tried to understand our environment.
