Could you tell me a little more about your responsibilities there?\nW: Sure. I was responsible for overseeing about 30 employees. I did all of the ordering for the store, and I kept track of the inventory.\nM: [20]What was the most difficult part of your job?\nW: Probably handling angry customers. We didn’t have them very often, but when we did, I needed to make sure they were well taken care of. After all, the customer is always right.\nM: That’s how we feel here too. How long did you work there?\nW: I was there for three and a half years. I left the company last month. \nM: And why did you leave? \nW: [21]My husband has been transferred to Boston. And I understand your company has an opening there too. \nM: Yes, that’s right. We do. [22]But the position won’t start until early next month. Would that be a problem for you?\nW: No, not at all. My husband’s new job doesn’t begin for a few weeks. So we thought we would spend some time driving to Boston and stop to see my parents.\nM: That sounds nice. So tell me, why are you interested in this particular position?\nW: I know that your company has a great reputation, and a wonderful product. I’ve thought many times that I would like to be a part of it. When I heard about the opening in Boston, I jumped to the opportunity. \nM: Well, I’m glad you did.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/200912/200912C1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102606,"title":"What was the woman’s previous job?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n对话开头处manager“经理”，与B选项manager构成视听一致。女士曾在一家电脑商店当过经理，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"A director of a sales department."},{"option":2,"content":"A manager at a computer store."},{"option":3,"content":"A sales clerk at a shopping center."},{"option":4,"content":"An accountant of a computer firm."}]},{"id":102607,"title":"What does the woman say was the most difficult part of her job?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词most后面handling angry customers“应对愤怒的顾客”，与A选项Handling customer complaints“应对顾客的抱怨”构成同义替换。女士说应对愤怒的顾客是她工作中最难的部分，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Handling customer complaints."},{"option":2,"content":"Recruiting and training new staff."},{"option":3,"content":"Dispatching ordered goods on time."},{"option":4,"content":"Developing computer programs."}]},{"id":102608,"title":"Why is the woman looking for a job in Boston?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n女士话中My husband has been transferred to Boston“我丈夫被调往波士顿”，与D选项She wants to be with her husband“她想跟丈夫在一起”构成同义替换。女士想去波士顿工作的原因是想和她的丈夫在一起，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"She likes something more challenging."},{"option":2,"content":"She likes to be nearer to her parents."},{"option":3,"content":"She wants to have a better-paid job."},{"option":4,"content":"She wants to be with her husband."}]},{"id":102609,"title":"When can the woman start to work if she gets the job?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词But后面early next month“下个月早些时候”，与C选项“让Early next month构成视听一致。女士要到下个月早些时候才开始工作，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Right away."},{"option":2,"content":"In two months."},{"option":3,"content":"Early next month."},{"option":4,"content":"In a couple of days."}]}]},{"id":4601,"name":"2009.12 Conversation Two","content":"W: Today in the studio we have Alberto Cortez, the well-known Brazilian advocate of the anti-global movement. [23]He’s here to talk about the recent report, stating that by 2050 Brazil will be the one of the world’s wealthiest  and  most successful countries. Alberto, what do you say to the report?\nM: You know this isn’t the first time that people are saying Brazil will be a great economic power. The same thing was said over a hundred year ago. But it didn’t happen. \nW: Yes, but you must admit the world’s a very different place now.\nM: Of course. In fact I believe there’s maybe some truth in the prediction this time around. First of all, though, we must remember the problems facing Brazil at the moment.\nW: Such as…?\nM: [24]There’s an enormous gap between the rich and the poor in this country. In Sal Paulo, you can see shopping malls full of designer goods right next door to the slum areas without proper water and electricity supplies. A lot of work needs to be done to help people in those areas improve their lives.\nW: What needs to be done? \nM: Education, for example. For Brazil, to be successful, we need to offer education to all Brazilians. [25]Successful countries like South Korea and Singapore have excellent education systems. Brazil needs to learn from these countries. \nW: So you are hopeful for the future. \nM: As I said earlier, I’m hopeful. This isn’t an easy job. We need to make sure that these important opportunities for Brazil aren’t wasted, as they were in the past.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/200912/200912C2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102610,"title":"What does the recent report say about Brazil?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词most处wealthiest and most successful“最富有、最成功的”，与D选项major economic power“主要经济大国”构成视听一致。最近的报道说巴西将会成为经济大国，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It will face challenges unprecedented in its history.
