Not surprisingly, the costs are steep. For a middle-class, husband-and-wife family(average pretax income in 2009:$76,250), spending per child is about $12,000 a year. With inflation the family’s spending on a child will total $286,050 by age 17.\n    The dry statistics ought to inform the ongoing deficit debate, because a budget is not just a catalog of programs and taxes. It reflects a society’s priorities and values. Our society does not—despite rhetoric(说辞) to the contrary---put much value on raising children. Present budget policies tax reduction heavily to support the elderly. Meanwhile, tax breaks for children are modest. If deficit reduction aggravates these biases, more Americans may choose not to have children are modest. If deficit reduction aggravates there biases, more Americans may choose not to have children or to have fewer children. Down that path lies economic decline.\n    Societies that cannot replace their populations discourage investment and innovation. They have stagnant(萧条的) or shrinking markets for goods and services. With older populations, they resist change, To stabilize its population---discounting immigration---women must have an average of two children. That’s a fertility rate of 2.0. Many countries with struggling economies are well below that.\n    Though having a child is a deeply personal decision, it’s shaped by culture, religion, economics, and government policy. “No one has a good answer” as to why fertility varies among countries, says sociologist Andrew Chilin of The Johns Hopkins University. Eroding religious belief in Europe may partly explain lowered birthrates. In Japan young women may be rebelling against their mothers’ isolated lives of child rearing. General optimism and pessimism count. Hopefulness fueled America’s baby boom. After the Soviet Union’s collapse, says Chilin,” anxiety for the future” depressed birthrates in Russia and Eastern Europe.\n    In poor societies, people have children to improve their economic well-being by increasing the number of family workers and providing support for parents in their old age. In wealthy societies, the logic often reverses. Government now supports the elderly, diminishing the need for children. By some studies, the safely nets for retirees have reduced fertility rates by 0.5 children in the United States and almost 1.0 in Western Europe, reports economist Robert Stein in the journal National Affairs. Similarly, some couples don’t have children because they don’t want to sacrifice their own lifestyles to the time and expense of a family.\n    Young Americans already face a bleak labor market that cannot instill(注入) confidence about having children, Piling on higher taxes won’t help, ”If higher taxes make it more expensive to raise children, ” says Nicholas Bierstadt of the American Enterprise Institute,” people will think twice about having another child..” That seems like common sense, despite the multiple influences on becoming parents.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103314,"title":"What do we learn from the government report?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的government report定位到文章首段第一、二句。\n解析：文章第一段第一句说，Among the government’s most interesting reports is one that estimates what parents spend on their children，“在政府的众多报告中，最有趣的是一份估算父母在子女身上所话费用的报告”；第二句说，Not surprisingly, the costs are steep，“相关费用急剧增加，这一点不足为奇”。所以，我们从政府报告中能够获得的信息是抚养孩子的花销大增，既B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Inflation increases families’ expenses."},{"option":2,"content":"Raising children is getting expensive."},{"option":3,"content":"Budget reduction is around the corner."},{"option":4,"content":"Average family expenditure is increasing."}]},{"id":103315,"title":"What is said to be the consequence of s shrinking population?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的the consequence of s shrinking population定位到文章第二段最后两句。\n解析：第二段倒数第二句说，If deficit reduction aggravates there biases, more Americans may choose not to have children or to have fewer children，“若削减赤字的政策进一步加剧这种偏差，可能会导致更多美国人选择不要或少要孩子”；倒数第一句说，Down that path lies economic decline，“这样下去会导致经济衰退”。可见，人口缩减带来的结果是经济衰退，既C选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Weakened national strength."},{"option":2,"content":"Increased immigration."},{"option":3,"content":"Economic downturn."},{"option":4,"content":"Social instability."}]},{"id":103316,"title":"What accounted for America’s baby boom?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的America’s baby boom定位到文章第四段第六句。\n解析：定位句说，Hopefulness fueled America’s baby boom，“希望点燃了美国生育高峰”，这里的hopefullness即A选项Optimism for the future，“对未来的乐观精神”，故答案为A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Optimism for the future."},{"option":2,"content":"Improved living conditions."},{"option":3,"content":"Religious beliefs."},{"option":4,"content":"Economic prosperity."}]},{"id":103317,"title":"Why do people in wealthy countries prefer to have fewer children?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的wealthy countries定位到文章第五段第二至四句。\n解析：文章第五段第二句说，In wealthy societies, the logic often reverses，“在富裕社会，这一逻辑与贫穷社会相反”；第三句说， Government now supports the elderly, diminishing the need for children，“由于政府现在大力支持老年人，减少了对子女的需求”；第四句中，the safely nets for retirees have reduced fertility rates by 0.5 children in the United States and almost 1.0 in Western Europe，“为退休人员织就的安全网导致人们倾向于少生孩子”。所以，富裕社会的人们倾向于少生孩子的原因是人们不需要养儿防老，即D选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They want to further improve their economic well-being."},{"option":2,"content":"They cannot afford the time and expenses of rearing children."},{"option":3,"content":"They are concerned about the future of the coming generation."},{"option":4,"content":"They don’t rely on their children to support them in old age."}]},{"id":103318,"title":"What is the author’s purpose in writing the passage?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的purpose in writing the passage可知，本题考查文章主旨。对于主旨题，要特别注意首尾段以及每段首句。\n解析：最后一段引用Nicholas Bierstadt的话总结全文。该段第二句中说，更高的税收将导致抚养子女的费用更高，对于再生育一个子女的问题，人们可能会三思而后行。再加上之前作者提到人口缩减会导致经济衰退。所以作者写这篇文章的目的是，提倡降低抚养税费，提高生育率，即D选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"To instill confidence in the young about raising children."},{"option":2,"content":"To advise couples to think twice before having children."},{"option":3,"content":"To encourage the young to take care of the elderly."},{"option":4,"content":"To appeal for tax reduction for raising children."}]}]},{"id":5284,"name":"2013.12 (Passage Two 卷一)","content":"    Space exploration has always been the province of dreamers: The human imagination readily soars where human ingenuity(创造力) struggles to follow. A Voyage to the Moon, often cited as the first science fiction story, was written by Cyrano de Bergerac in 1649. Cyrano was dead and buried for a good three centuries before the first manned rockets started to fly.\n    In 1961, when President Kennedy declared that America send a man to the moon by the decade’s end, those words, too, had a dreamlike quality. They resonated(共鸣) with optimism and ambition in much the same way as the most famous dream speech of all, delivered by Martin Luther King Jr. two years later. By the end of the decades, both visions had yielded concrete results and others. The fight for racial and economic equality is intensely pragmatic(讲求实用的) and immediate in its impact. The urge to explore spare is just the opposite. It is figuratively and literally otherworldly in its aims.\n    When the dust settled, the space dreamers lost out.. There was no grand follow-up to the Apollo missions. The technologically compromised space shuttle program has just come to an end, with no successor. The perpetual argument is that funds are tight, that we have more pressing problems here on Earth. Amid the current concerns about the federal deficit, reaching toward the stars seems a dispensable luxury---as if saving one-thousandth of a single years’ budget would solve our problems.\n    But human ingenuity struggles on. NASA is developing a series of robotic probes that will get the most bang from a buck. They will serve as modern Magellan, mapping out the solar system for whatever explorers follow, whether man or machine. On the flip side, companies like Virgin Galactic are plotting a bottom-up assault on the space dream, by making it a reality to the public. Private Spaceflight could lie within reach of rich civilians in a few years. Another decade or two and it could go mainstream.\n    The space dreamers end up benefiting all of us---not just because of the way they expand human knowledge, or because of the spin-off technologies they produce, but because the two types of dreams feed off each other. Both Martin Luther King and John Kennedy appealed to the idea that humans can transcend what were once considered inherent limitations. Today we face seeming challenges in energy, the environment, health care. Tomorrow we still transcend there as well, and the dreamers will deserve a lot of the credit.. The more evidence we collect that our species is capable of greatness; the more we will actually achieve it.
