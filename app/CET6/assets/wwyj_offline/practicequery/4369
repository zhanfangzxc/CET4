[26]The plane, a Boeing 737, taking German holiday makers to the island, crashed into a hillside as it circled while preparing to land. The plane was carrying 180 passengers. It’s thought there are no survivors. Rescue workers were at the scene. \n    [27]The British industrialist James Louis, held by kidnappers in central Africa for the past 8 months, was released unharmed yesterday. The kidnappers had been demanding 1 million pounds for the release of Mr. Louis. The London Bank and their agents who have been negotiating with the kidnappers have not said whether any amount of money has been paid. \n    The 500 UK motors workers who had been on strike in High Town for the past 3 three weeks went back to work this morning. [28]This follows successful talks between management and union representatives, which resulted in a new agreement on working hours and conditions. A spokesman for the management said that they’d hope they could now get back to producing cars, and that they lost a lot of money and orders over this dispute. \n    And finally the weather. After a cold start, most of the country should be warm and sunny. [29]But towards late afternoon, rain will spread from Scotland to cover most parts by midnight.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/201006/20106P1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102703,"title":"What does the news say about the Boeing 737 plane?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n原文中crashed …circled … to land“坠毁…盘旋…降落”，与C选项crashed … circling to land“坠毁…盘旋降落”构成视听一致。文章说一架波音737客机搭载着要去Tenerife岛旅行的德国游客，在盘旋降落时撞上山坡失事了，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"A terrorist forced it to land on Tenerife."},{"option":2,"content":"It carried passengers leaving an island."},{"option":3,"content":"It crashed when it was circling to land."},{"option":4,"content":"18 of its passengers survived the crash."}]},{"id":102704,"title":"What happened to British industrialist James Louis?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n原文中held by kidnappers …for the past 8 months“已被绑架八个月”，与A选项was kidnapped eight months ago“八个月前被绑架”构成同义替换。文章说James Louis在中非被绑架达8个月之久，昨天终于被安全释放了，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He was kidnapped eight months ago."},{"option":2,"content":"He failed in his negotiations with the Africans"},{"option":3,"content":"He was assassinated in Central Africa."},{"option":4,"content":"He lost lots of money in his African business."}]},{"id":102705,"title":"How did the three week strike in High Town end?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n原文中management and union representatives… a new agreement“管理层与工会代表…新的协议”，与C选项management and union representatives … an agreement构成视听一致。管理层与工会代表就工作时间和工作条件达成了一份新的协议，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The trade union gave up its demand."},{"option":2,"content":"The workers on strike were all fired."},{"option":3,"content":"The management and union representatives reached an agreement."},{"option":4,"content":"The workers' pay was raised and their working hours were shortened."}]},{"id":102706,"title":"What kind of weather will be expected by midnight in most parts of the country?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词But后面rain“雨”，与D选项Rainy“多雨的”构成视听一致。文章说从傍晚开始，苏格兰地区将迎来降雨，并在午夜之前逐渐蔓延到全国大部分地区，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Sunny."},{"option":2,"content":"Windy."},{"option":3,"content":"Cloudy."},{"option":4,"content":"Rainy."}]}]},{"id":4698,"name":"2010.6 Passage Two","content":"    Juan Louis, a junior geology major, decided to give an informative speech about how earthquakes occur. [30]From his audience and analysis he learned that only 2 or 3 of his classmates knew much of anything about geology. Juan realized then that he must present his speech at an elementary level and with a minimum of scientific language. \n    As he prepared the speech, Juan kept asking himself, “How can I make this clear and meaningful to someone who knows nothing about earthquakes or geological principles?” [31]Since he was speaking in the Midwest, he decided to begin by noting that the most severe earthquake in American history took place not in California or Alaska but at New Madrid, Missouri in 1811. If such an earthquake happened today, it would be felt from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean and would flatten most of the cities in the Mississippi valley. That, he figured, should get his classmates’ attention. \n    Throughout the body of the speech, Juan dealt only with the basic mechanics of earthquakes, and carefully avoided technical terms. He also prepared visual aids, diagramming photolines, so his classmates wouldn’t get confused. To be absolutely safe, Juan asked his roommate, who was not a geology major, to listen to the speech. [32]“Stop me,” he said, “any time I say something you don’t understand.” Juan’s roommate stopped him four times. And at each spot, Juan worked out a way to make his point more clearly.

It was created by Ludwig Lazar Zamenhof, a Polish Jewish doctor specialized in eye diseases. Esperanto was first presented in 1887. An international movement was launched to promote its use. [34]Despite arguments and disagreements, the movement has continued to flourish and has members in more than 80 countries.\n    Esperanto is used internationally across language boundaries by at least 1 million people, particularly in specialized fields. It is used in personal contexts, on radio broadcasts and in a number of publications, as well as in translations of both modern works and classics. Its popularity has spread from Europe, both east and west, to such countries as Brazil and Japan. [35]It is, however, in China that Esperanto has had its  greatest impact. It is taught in universities and used in many translations, often in scientific or technological works. EL POPOLA CHINIO, which means “From People’s China”, it’s a monthly magazine in Esperanto and it’s read worldwide. Radio Beijing’s Esperanto program is the most popular program in Esperanto in the world.\n    Esperanto’s vocabulary is drawn primarily from Latin, the Roman’s languages, English and German. Spelling is completely regular. A simple and consistent set of endings indicates grammatical functions of words. Thus for example, every noun ends in “o”, every adjective in “a”, and a basic form of every verb in “i”. Esperanto also has a highly productive system of constructing new words from old ones.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/201006/20106P3.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102710,"title":"What does the speaker tell us about Esperanto?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n文章开头处means of communication among speakers of different languages“不同语言使用者的交流工具”，与A选项a tool of communication among speakers of different languages构成同义替换，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is a tool of communication among speakers of different languages."},{"option":2,"content":"It is a language that has its origin in ancient Polish."},{"option":3,"content":"It was invented by a group of language experts in the year of 1887."},{"option":4,"content":"It was created to promote economic globalization."}]},{"id":102711,"title":"What is said about the international movement to promote the use of Esperanto?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词more than处members in more than 80 countries“成员遍布超过80个国家”，与C选项supporters from many countries“许多国家都有支持者”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It aims to make Esperanto a working language in the U.
