[27]In a study analyzing data on thousands of Ohio State freshmen who lived in dorms, he found that black freshmen who came to college with high standardized test scores earned better grades if they had a white roommate—even if the roommate’s test scores were low. The roommate’s race had no effect on the grades of white students or low-scoring black students. Perhaps, the study speculated having a white roommate helps academically prepared black students adjust to a predominantly white university.\n    [28]That same study found that randomly assigned interracial roommates at Ohio State broke up before the end of the quarter about twice as often as same-race roommates. Because interracial roommate relationships are often problematic, Dr. Fazio said, many students would like to move out, but university housing policies may make it hard to leave.\n    “At Indiana University, where housing was not so tight, more interracial roommates split up,” he said. “Here at Ohio State, where housing was tight, they were told to work it out. The most interesting thing we found was that if the relationship managed to continue for just 10 weeks, [29]we could see an improvement in racial attitudes.”\n    Dr. Fazio’s Indiana study found that three times as many randomly assigned interracial roommates were no longer living together at the end of the semester, compared with white roommates. The interracial roommates spent less time together, and had fewer joint activities than the white pairs.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/201206/20126P1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102743,"title":"What do we know about Russell Fazio?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n文章开头处psychology professor“心理学教授”，与A选项teaches psychology“教心理学”构成同义替换，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He teaches psychology at Ohio State University."},{"option":2,"content":"He provides counseling for university students."},{"option":3,"content":"He specializes in interpersonal relationships."},{"option":4,"content":"He has experience tutoring black students."}]},{"id":102744,"title":"Who benefited from living with a white roommate according to Fazio’s study?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n原文中black freshmen … with high standardized test scores“测试分数高的黑人新生”，与D选项Black freshmen with high standardized test scores构成视听一致。Fazio研究发现测试分数高的黑人新生如果与白人住在同一寝室的话，黑人学生能够取得更好的成绩，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Students who scored low standardized tests."},{"option":2,"content":"Black students from families with low incomes."},{"option":3,"content":"Students who are accustomed to living in dorms."},{"option":4,"content":"Black freshmen with high standardized test scores."}]},{"id":102745,"title":"What did the study find about randomly assigned interracial roommates at Ohio State University?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词as often as后面broke up … twice as often as same-race roommates“关系破裂的几率是相同人种室友的两倍”，与C选项They broke up more often than same-race roommates“他们的关系破裂的几率比相同人种室友要高”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They moved out of the college dorms at the end of the semester."},{"option":2,"content":"They were more appreciative of the university’s housing policy."},{"option":3,"content":"They broke up more often than same-race roommates."},{"option":4,"content":"They generally spend more time together that white pairs."}]},{"id":102746,"title":"What did Dr. Fazio find interesting about interracial roommates who had lived together for 10 weeks?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n原文中improvement in racial attitudes“对于种族的态度有改善”，与C选项racial attitudes improved构成视听一致。Dr. Fazio发现如果黑白人种混住宿舍的情况能够维持10周以上，舍友间对待其他种族的态度就会改善，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They started doing similar activities."},{"option":2,"content":"Their test scores rose gradually."},{"option":3,"content":"Their racial attitudes improved."},{"option":4,"content":"They grew bored of each other."}]}]},{"id":4738,"name":"2012.6 Passage Two","content":"    In a small laboratory at the Medical University of South Carolina, Dr. Vladimir Mironov has been working for a decade to grow meat. A developmental biologist and tissue engineer, Dr. Mironov, is one of only a few scientists worldwide involved in bioengineering cultured meat.

[33]Jackson spent five years in prison after a jury wrongly convicted him of raping two women. At Jackson's trial, although two witnesses testified that Jackson was with them in another location at the times of the crimes, he was convicted anyway. Why? [34]The jury believed the testimony of the two victims, who positively identified Jackson as the man who has attacked them. The court eventually freed Jackson after the police found the man who had really committed the crimes. Jackson was similar in appearance to the guilty man. The two women has made a mistake in identity. As a result, Jackson has lost five years of his life.\n    The two women in this case were eyewitnesses. They clearly saw the man who attacked them, yet they mistakenly identified an innocent person. Similar incidents have occurred before. Eyewitnesses to other crimes have identified the wrong person in a police lineup or in photographs.\n    [35]Many factors influence the accuracy of eyewitness testimony. For instance, witnesses sometimes see photographs of several suspects before they try to identify the person they saw in a lineup of people. They can become confused by seeing many photographs or similar faces. The number of people in the lineup, and whether it is a live lineup or a photograph, may also affect a witness's decision. People sometimes have difficulty identifying people of other races. The questions the police ask witnesses also have an effect on them.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/201206/20126P3.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102750,"title":"What do we learn about Bernard Jackson?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n文章开头处prison … wrongly“监狱…冤枉”，与A选项wrongly imprisoned“含冤入狱”构成视听一致。Bernard Jackson被陪审团冤枉，坐了五年牢，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He was wrongly imprisoned."},{"option":2,"content":"He is a habitual criminal."},{"option":3,"content":"He has better memories of childhood."},{"option":4,"content":"He was accused of family violence."}]},{"id":102751,"title":"What led directly to Jackson’s sentence?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n原文中two victims… identified“两个受害者指认”，与A选项two victims’ identification构成视听一致。Jackson被判入狱是因为陪审团相信受害者的指认，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The two victims’ identification."},{"option":2,"content":"The testimony of his two friends."},{"option":3,"content":"The jury’s prejudice against his race."},{"option":4,"content":"The evidence found at the crime scene."}]},{"id":102752,"title":"What lesson do we learn from Jackson’s case?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n原文中Many factors influence the accuracy of eyewitness testimony“许多因素影响着目击证人证词的准确度”，与B选项构成视听一致，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Frightened victims can rarely make correct identification."},{"option":2,"content":"Many factors influence the accuracy of witness testimony."},{"option":3,"content":"Eyewitnesses are often misled by the layer’s questions."},{"option":4,"content":"The US judicial system has much room for improvement."}]}]}]}
