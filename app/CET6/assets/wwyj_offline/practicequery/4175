I did all of the ordering for the store, and I kept track of the inventory.\nM: [20]What was the most difficult part of your job?\nW: Probably handling angry customers. We didn’t have them very often, but when we did, I needed to make sure they were well taken care of. After all, the customer is always right.\nM: That’s how we feel here too. How long did you work there?\nW: I was there for three and a half years. I left the company last month. \nM: And why did you leave? \nW: [21]My husband has been transferred to Boston. And I understand your company has an opening there too. \nM: Yes, that’s right. We do. [22]But the position won’t start until early next month. Would that be a problem for you?\nW: No, not at all. My husband’s new job doesn’t begin for a few weeks. So we thought we would spend some time driving to Boston and stop to see my parents.\nM: That sounds nice. So tell me, why are you interested in this particular position?\nW: I know that your company has a great reputation, and a wonderful product. I’ve thought many times that I would like to be a part of it. When I heard about the opening in Boston, I jumped to the opportunity. \nM: Well, I’m glad you did.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/200912/200912C1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102046,"title":"What was the woman’s previous job?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n对话开头处manager“经理”，与B选项manager构成视听一致。女士曾在一家电脑商店当过经理，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"A director of a sales department."},{"option":2,"content":"A manager at a computer store."},{"option":3,"content":"A sales clerk at a shopping center."},{"option":4,"content":"An accountant of a computer firm."}]},{"id":102047,"title":"What does the woman say was the most difficult part of her job?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词most后面handling angry customers“应对愤怒的顾客”，与A选项Handling customer complaints“应对顾客的抱怨”构成同义替换。女士说应对愤怒的顾客是她工作中最难的部分，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Handling customer complaints."},{"option":2,"content":"Recruiting and training new staff."},{"option":3,"content":"Dispatching ordered goods on time."},{"option":4,"content":"Developing computer programs."}]},{"id":102048,"title":"Why is the woman looking for a job in Boston?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n女士话中My husband has been transferred to Boston“我丈夫被调往波士顿”，与D选项She wants to be with her husband“她想跟丈夫在一起”构成同义替换。女士想去波士顿工作的原因是想和她的丈夫在一起，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"She likes something more challenging."},{"option":2,"content":"She likes to be nearer to her parents."},{"option":3,"content":"She wants to have a better-paid job."},{"option":4,"content":"She wants to be with her husband."}]},{"id":102049,"title":"When can the woman start to work if she gets the job?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词But后面early next month“下个月早些时候”，与C选项“让Early next month构成视听一致。女士要到下个月早些时候才开始工作，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Right away."},{"option":2,"content":"In two months."},{"option":3,"content":"Early next month."},{"option":4,"content":"In a couple of days."}]}]},{"id":4041,"name":"2011.6 Conversation Two","content":"W: Your name is Sanjay Kumar, is that correct?\nM: Yes, madam.\nW: You claim you are traveling on a scholarship from Delhi University.\nM: That's right.\nW: [23]Now it seems that a handgun was found in your luggage.
