Sales at online retailers gained by more than 15%, making it the biggest season ever. But people are also returning those purchases at record rates, up 8% from last year.\n    What went wrong? Is the lingering shadow of the global financial crisis making it harder to accept extravagant indulgences? Or that people shop more impulsively—and therefore make bad decisions—when online? Both arguments are plausible. However, there is a third factor: a question of touch. We can love the look but, in an online environment, we cannot feel the quality of a texture, the shape of the fit, the fall of a fold or, for that matter, the weight of an earring. And physically interacting with an object makes you more committed to your purchase.\n    When my most recent book Brandwashed was released, I teamed up with a local bookstore to conduct an experiment about the difference between the online and offline shopping experience. I carefully instructed a group of volunteers to promote my book in two different ways. The first was a fairly hands-off approach. Whenever a customer would inquire about my book, the volunteer would take them over to the shelf and point to it. Out of 20 such requests, six customers proceeded with the purchase.\n    The second option also involved going over to the shelf but, this time, removing the book and them subtly holding onto it for just an extra moment before placing it in the customer’s hands. Of the 20 people who were handed the book, 13 ended up buying it. Just physically passing the book showed a big difference in sales. Why? We feel something similar to a sense of ownership when we hold things in our hand. That’s why we establish or reestablish connection by greeting strangers and friends with a handshake. In this case, having to then let go of the book after holding it might generate a subtle sense of loss, and motivate us to make the purchase even more.\n    A recent study also revealed the power of touch, in this case when it came to conventional mail. A deeper and longer-lasting impression of a message was formed when delivered in a letter, as opposed to receiving the same message online. Brain imaging showed that, on touching the paper, the emotional center of the brain was activated, thus forming a stronger bond. The study also indicated that once touch becomes part of the process, it could translate into a sense of possession.\n    This sense of ownership is simply not part of the equation in the online shopping experience.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103170,"title":"Why do people prefer shopping online according to the author?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的prefer shopping online定位到第一段第一句。\n解析：定位句说，In 2011, many shoppers chose to avoid the frantic crowds and do their holiday shopping from the comfort of their computer，“在2011年，许多消费者选择避开疯狂的人群；舒舒服服地通过电脑购买节日物品”。可见，舒适和方便是消费者选择网上购物的主要原因。故A选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is more comfortable and convenient."},{"option":2,"content":"It saves them a lot of money and time."},{"option":3,"content":"It offers them a lot more options and bargains."},{"option":4,"content":"It gives them more time to think about their purchase."}]},{"id":103171,"title":"Why do more customers return their purchases bought online?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的return their purchases bought online和why定位到第一段最后句和第二段全段。\n解析：第一段最后一句说网购退货率破纪录，接下来作者在第二段给出原因。除了金融危机和冲动消费这两个退货原因，第二段第5句作者说，However, there is a third factor: a question of touch，“还有第三个因素：触摸”。可见消费者无法触摸到商品也是退货的原因，故C选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They regretted indulging in costly items in the recession."},{"option":2,"content":"They changed their mind by the time the goods were delivered."},{"option":3,"content":"They had no chance to touch them when shopping online."},{"option":4,"content":"They later found the quality of goods below their expectations."}]},{"id":103172,"title":"What is the purpose of author’s experiment?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的experiment定位到第三段第一句。\n解析：定位句说，When my most recent book Brandwashed was released, I teamed up with a local bookstore to conduct an experiment about the difference between the online and offline shopping experience，“当我的新书发行时，我与一家当地书店一起做了一个关于线上线下购物体验差异的实验”。第三段后面是实验的过程，关键点是看顾客触摸书和不触摸书对购买的影响，即实验的目的是证实作者之前关于网购的猜想。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"To test his hypothesis about online shopping."},{"option":2,"content":"To find out people’s reaction to his recent book."},{"option":3,"content":"To find ways to increase the sale of his new book."},{"option":4,"content":"To try different approaches to sales promotion."}]},{"id":103173,"title":"How might people feel after letting go of something they held?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的letting go of something they held定位到第四段最后一句。\n解析：定位句说，In this case, having to then let go of the book after holding it might generate a subtle sense of loss, and motivate us to make the purchase even more，“把已经在手里拿了一会的书放下，会使人产生一种若有所失的感觉，从而刺激我们做出购买行为”。也就是说，先让人们拿一会儿，再从他们手中把东西拿走，会让人们更加想拥有这样东西，故B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"A sense of disappointment."},{"option":2,"content":"More motivated to own it."},{"option":3,"content":"A subtle loss of interest."},{"option":4,"content":"Less sensitive to its texture."}]},{"id":103174,"title":"What does brain imaging in a recent study reveal?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的brain imaging定位到第五段第三句和第四句。\n解析：第五段第三句说，Brain imaging showed that, on touching the paper, the emotional center of the brain was activated, thus forming a stronger bond，“脑部成像实验表明，在触摸纸张的时候，大脑的情绪中枢被激活，从而对该物品形成了一种更为强大的联系”。第四句说，The study also indicated that once touch becomes part of the process, it could translate into a sense of possession，“实验还表明一旦触摸成为一个必经程序，就会转化为占有欲”。由此可知，身体的触摸会转化为占有欲，故D选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Conventional letters contain subtle messages."},{"option":2,"content":"A lack of touch is the chief obstacle to e-commerce."},{"option":3,"content":"Email lacks the potential to activate the brain."},{"option":4,"content":"Physical touch helps form a sense of possession."}]}]},{"id":5141,"name":"2013.6 (Passage Two 卷三)","content":"    Apparently everyone knows that global warming only makes climate more extreme. A hot, dry summer has triggered another flood of such claims. And, while many interests are at work, one of the players that benefits the most from this story are the media: the notion of “extreme” climate simply makes for more compelling news.\n    Consider Paul Krugman writing breathlessly in the New York Times about the “rising incidence of extreme events,” He claims that global warming caused the current drought in America’s Midwest, and that supposedly record-high corn prices could cause a global food crisis.\n    But the United Nations climate panel’s latest assessment tells us precisely the opposite. For “North America there is medium confidence that there has an overall slight tendency toward less dryness”. Moreover, there is no way that Krugman could have identified this drought as being caused by global warming without a time machine; Climate models estimate that such detection will be possible by 2048, at the earliest.\n    And, fortunately, this year’s drought appears unlikely to cause a food crisis, as global rice and wheat supplies retain plentiful. Moreover, Krugman overlooks inflation: Prices have increased six-fold since 1969. so, while com futures(期货) did set a record of about S8 per bushel(葡式耳)in late July, the inflation-adjusted price of corn was higher throughout most of the 1970s, reaching 516 in1974.\n    Finally, Krugman conveniently forgets that concerns about global warming are the main reason that corn prices have skyrocketed since 2005. Nowadays 40 percent of corn grown in the United States is used to produce ethanol（乙醇）,which does absolutely nothing for the climate, but certainly distorts the price of corn—at the expense of many of the world’s poorest people.\n    Bill Mickbben similarly worries in The Guardian about the Midwest drought and corn prices. He confidently tells us that raging wildfires from New Mexico and Colorado to Siberia are “exactly” what the early stages of global warming look like.\n    In fact, the latest overview of global wildfire suggests that fire intensity has declined over the past 70 years and is now close to its preindustrial level.\n    When well-meaning campaigners want us to pay attention to global warming, they often end up pitching beyond the facts. And, while this may seem justified by a noble goal, such “policy by people” tactics rarely work, and often backfire.\n    Remember how, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Al Gore claimed that we were in store for ever more destructive hurricanes? Since then, hurricane incidence has dropped off the charts. Exaggerated claims merely fuel public distrust and disengagement.\n    That is unfortunate, because global warming is a real problem, and we do need to address it.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103175,"title":"In what way do the media benefit from extreme weather?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的media benefit from extreme weather定位到第一段第三句。\n解析：定位句说，while many interests are at work, one of the players that benefits the most from this story are the media: the notion of “extreme” climate simply makes for more compelling news，“当提及极端天气事件时，媒体是最大的获益者，极端天气这一概念总是让新闻更加瞩目”。也就是说，只要进行相关“极端”天气的报道，新闻媒体就可以得到人们的关注，故A选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They can attract people’s attention to their reports."},{"option":2,"content":"They can choose from a greater variety of topics."},{"option":3,"content":"They can make themselves better known."},{"option":4,"content":"They can give voice to different views."}]},{"id":103176,"title":"What is the author’s comment on Krugman’s claim about the current drought in America’s Midwest?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的drought定位到第三段最后一句。\n解析：定位句说，Moreover, there is no way that Krugman could have identified this drought as being caused by global warming without a time machine; Climate models estimate that such detection will be possible by 2048, at the earliest，“除非Krugman能够穿越时空，否则他没办法证明干旱是由全球变暖引起；这样的气候模式预测最早也要到2048年才有可能实现”，也就是说，目前没有任何方法来证明Krugman的言论是否属实。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"A time machine is needed to testify to its truth."},{"option":2,"content":"It is based on an erroneous climate model."},{"option":3,"content":"It will eventually get proof in 2048."},{"option":4,"content":"There is no way to prove its validity."}]},{"id":103177,"title":"What is the chief reason for the rise in corn prices according to the author?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的corn prices定位到第五段第一句。\n解析：定位句说玉米价格在2005年飞涨。定位句后面一句说，Nowadays 40 percent of corn grown in the United States is used to produce ethanol（乙醇）,which does absolutely nothing for the climate, but certainly distorts the price of corn—at the expense of many of the world’s poorest people，“目前美国40%的玉米被用于生产乙醇，这与气候没什么关系，不过，它却实实在在地扭曲了玉米价格”。即把玉米用作燃料是玉米价钱上涨的原因，即B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Demand for food has been rising in the developing countries."},{"option":2,"content":"A considerable portion of corn is used to produce green fuel."},{"option":3,"content":"Climate change has caused corn yields to drop markedly."},{"option":4,"content":"Inflation rates have been skyrocketing since the 1970s."}]},{"id":103178,"title":"What does the author say about global wildfire incidence over the past 70 years?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的global wildfire和over the past 70 years定位到第七段。\n解析：第七段说，In fact, the latest overview of global wildfire suggests that fire intensity has declined over the past 70 years and is now close to its preindustrial level，“最新的关于全球野外火灾事件的综述表明，在过去70年中，野外火灾的发生率一直呈下降趋势，现在已接近工业化以前的水平”。即野外火灾在过去70年中大幅下降，故C选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It has got worse with the rise in extreme weathers."},{"option":2,"content":"It signals the early stages of global warming."},{"option":3,"content":"It has dropped greatly."},{"option":4,"content":"It is related to drought."}]},{"id":103179,"title":"What does the author think of the exaggerated claims in the media about global warming?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的exaggerated claims定位到第九段最后一句。\n解析：定位句说，Exaggerated claims merely fuel public distrust and disengagement，“夸大的说法只能加剧公众的不信任”。在第十段中，作者说That is unfortunate, because global warming is a real problem, and we do need to address it，“这是不幸的，因为全球变暖的确是一个我们需要解决的问题”。由此可知，夸大的说法对解决问题起不到任何帮助，甚至会带来负面影响。故B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They are strategies to raise public awareness."},{"option":2,"content":"They do a disservice to addressing the problem."},{"option":3,"content":"They aggravate public distrust about science."},{"option":4,"content":"They create confusion about climate change."}]}]}]}
