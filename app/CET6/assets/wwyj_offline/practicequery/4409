Some law firms now use artificial intelligence software to scan and read mountains of legal documents, work that previously was performed by highly-paid human lawyers.\n    “Robots continue to have an impact on blue-collar jobs, and white-collar jobs are under attack by microprocessors,” says economics professor Edward Leamer. The recession permanently wiped out 2.5 million jobs. U.S. gross domestic product has climbed back to pre-recession levels, meaning we’re producing as much as before, only with 6% fewer workers. To be sure, robotics are not the only job killers out there, with outsourcing (外包) stealing far more jobs than automation.\n    Jeff Burnstein, president of the Robotics Industry Association, argues that robots actually save U.S. jobs. His logic: companies that embrace automation might use fewer workers, but that’s still better than firing everyone and moving the work overseas.\n    It’s not that robots are cheaper than humans, though often they are. It’s that they’re better. “In some cases the quality requirements are so exacting that even if you wanted to have a human do the job, you couldn’t,” Burnstein says.\n    Same goes for surgeons, who’re using robotic systems to perform an ever-growing list of operations—not because the machines save money but because, thanks to the greater precision of robots, the patients recover in less time and have fewer complications, says Dr. Myriam Curet.\n    Surgeons may survive the robot invasion, but others at the hospital might not be so lucky, as iRobot, maker of the Roomba, a robot vacuum cleaner, has been showing off Ava, which could be used as a messenger in a hospital. And once you’re home, recovering, Ava could let you talk to your doctor, so there’s no need to send someone to your house. That “mobile telepresence” could be useful at the office. If you’re away on a trip, you can still attend a meeting. Just connect via videoconferencing software, so your face appears on Ava’s screen.\n    Is any job safe? I was hoping to say “journalist,” but researchers are already developing software that can gather facts and write a news story, which means that a few years from now, a robot could be writing this column. And who will read it? Well, there might be a lot of us hanging around with lots of free time on our hands.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103130,"title":"What do we learn from the first few paragraphs?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的the first few paragraphs和选项中的professional work, economic recession定位到文章前四段。\n解析：文章第一段说，there’s one category of worker that the economic disruption has been good for: nonhumans，“在经济不振的局势中，有一种工人却从中受益，即非人类工人（机器人）”。第二段至四段提到机器人不仅替代了蓝领的工作，也替代了白领的工作，把人类从其岗位上驱逐出去。由此可知机器人产业在经济衰退中受益，故D选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The over-use of robots has done damage to American economy."},{"option":2,"content":"It is hard for robots to replace humans in highly professional work."},{"option":3,"content":"Artificial intelligence is key to future technological innovations."},{"option":4,"content":"The robotic industry has benefited from the economic recession."}]},{"id":103131,"title":"What caused the greatest loss of jobs in America?","textExplain":"定位：由greatest loss of jobs定位到文章第四段第四句。\n解析：定位句说robotics are not the only job killers out there, with outsourcing (外包) stealing far more jobs than automation，“机器人并非唯一的工作杀手，业务外包分流了更多的工作岗位”。由此可见，机器人产业取代了部分人类的工作，而导致美国人工作岗位减少的最主要原因是业务外包给海外。故B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Using microprocessors extensively."},{"option":2,"content":"Moving production to other countries."},{"option":3,"content":"The bankruptcy of many companies."},{"option":4,"content":"The invasion of migrant workers."}]},{"id":103132,"title":"What does Jeff Burnstein say about robots?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的Jeff Burnstein定位到文章第五段。\n解析：文章第五段第一句说， Jeff Burnstein认为，机器人实际上挽救了美国的工作岗位。第二句指出企业自动化会导致用工量下降，但是总比把工作外包给海外好，即机器人产业在某种程度上避免了美国本土的工作流失。故C选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They help companies to revive."},{"option":2,"content":"They are cheaper than humans."},{"option":3,"content":"They prevent job losses in a way."},{"option":4,"content":"They compete with human workers."}]},{"id":103133,"title":"Why are robotic systems replacing surgeons in more and more operations according to Dr. Myriam Curet?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的surgeons和Dr. Myriam Curet定位到文章第七段。\n解析：文章第七段提到， Jeff Burnstein医生说， Same goes for surgeons, who’re using robotic systems to perform an ever-growing list of operations—not because the machines save money but because, thanks to the greater precision of robots, the patients recover in less time and have fewer complications，“外科医生采用机器人进行手术的手术名单正不断增加，不是因为机器人更省钱，而是因为机器人操作精确度更高，所以病人恢复的更快，并发症更少”。由此可见，机器人取代外科医生只要是因为它们在精确性方面比人类做得更好。故B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They save lots of money for the patients."},{"option":2,"content":"They beat humans in precision."},{"option":3,"content":"They take less time to perform a surgery."},{"option":4,"content":"They make operations less painful."}]},{"id":103134,"title":"What does the author imply about robotics?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的the author和imply定位到文章最后一段\n解析：最后一段作者说他曾经设想过或许新闻行业可以避免使用机器人，but researchers are already developing software that can gather facts and write a news story，“但是研究人员已经在开发能够收集材料和写新闻稿的软件了”。由此可见，作者暗示机器人可以被应用到所有能够想象到的领域。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It will greatly enrich literary creation."},{"option":2,"content":"It will start a new technological revolution."},{"option":3,"content":"It will revolutionize scientific research."},{"option":4,"content":"It will be applied in any field imaginable."}]}]},{"id":5101,"name":"2012.12 (Passage Two 卷一)","content":"    You’ve now heard it so many times, you can probably repeat it in your sleep. President Obama will no doubt make the point publicly when he gets to Beijing: the Chinese need to consume more; they need—believe it or not—to become more like Americans, for the sake of the global economy.\n    And it’s all true. But the other side of that equation is that the U.S. needs to save more. For the moment, American households actually are doing so. After the personal-savings rate dipped to zero in 2005, the shock of the economic crisis last year prompted people to snap shut their wallets.\n    In China, the household-savings rate exceeds 20%. It is partly for policy reasons. As we’ve seen, wage earners are expected to care for not only their children but their aging parents. And there is, to date, only the flimsiest (脆弱的) of publicly-funded health care and pension systems, which increases incentives for individuals to save while they are working. But China is a society that has long esteemed personal financial prudence (谨慎). There is no chance that will change anytime soon, even if the government creates a better social safety net and successfully encourages greater consumer spending.\n    Why does the U.S. need to learn a little frugality (节俭)？Because healthy savings rates are one of the surest indicators of a country’s long-term financial health. High savings lead, over time, to increased investment, which in turn generates productivity gains, innovation and job growth. In short, savings are the seed corn of a good economic harvest.\n    The U.S. government thus needs to act as well. By running constant deficits, it is dis-saving, even as households save more. Peter Orszag, Obama’s Budget Director, recently called the U.S. budget deficits unsustainable and he’s right. To date, the U.S. has seemed unable to see the consequences of spending so much more than is taken in. That needs to change. And though Hu Jintao and the rest of the Chinese leadership aren’t inclined to lecture visiting Presidents, he might gently hint that Beijing is getting a little nervous about the value of the dollar—which has fallen 15% since March, in large part because of increasing fears that America’s debt load is becoming unmanageable.\n    That’s what happens when you’re the world’s biggest creditor: you get to drop hints like that, which would be enough by themselves to create international economic chaos if they were ever leaked. (Every time any official in Beijing deliberates publicly about seeking an alternative to the U.S. dollar for the $2.1 trillion China holds in reserve, currency traders have a heart attack.) If Americans saved more and spent less, consistently over time, they wouldn’t have to worry about all that.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103135,"title":"How did the economic crisis affect Americans?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的the economic crisis定位到文章第二段第四句。\n解析：定位句中，the shock of the economic crisis last year prompted people to snap shut their wallets，“经济危机使得美国民众收紧钱包”，也就是A选项中的tighten their belts，“勒紧腰带，节省开支”，故A选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They had to tighten their belts."},{"option":2,"content":"Their bank savings rate dropped to zero."},{"option":3,"content":"Their leadership in the global economy was shaken."},{"option":4,"content":"They became concerned about China’s financial policy."}]},{"id":103136,"title":"What should be done to encourage Chinese people to consume?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的encourage Chinese people to consume定位到文章第三段第五句。\n解析：第三段说中国人的储蓄率较高，即消费水平较低，It is partly for policy reasons，“一部分的原因是政策性的”，具体来讲是因为the flimsiest (脆弱的) of publicly-funded health care and pension systems，“公共医疗和养老金制度比较脆弱”。所以，要鼓励中国人消费更多，就需要完善社会保障体系。故C选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Changing their traditional way of life."},{"option":2,"content":"Providing fewer incentives for saving."},{"option":3,"content":"Improving China’s social security system."},{"option":4,"content":"Cutting down the expenses on child-rearing."}]},{"id":103137,"title":"What does the author mean by saying “savings are the seed corn of a good economic harvest” (Line 4, Para. 4)?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干提示定位至第四段最后一句。\n解析：定位句说savings are the seed corn of a good economic harvest，储蓄是经济丰收的根本。可知健康的储蓄可以促进经济繁荣，即D选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The more one saves, the more returns one will reap."},{"option":2,"content":"A country’s economy hinges on its savings policy."},{"option":3,"content":"Those who keep saving will live an easy life in the end."},{"option":4,"content":"A healthy savings rate promotes economic prosperity."}]},{"id":103138,"title":"In what circumstances do currency traders become scared?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的currency traders定位到文章最后一段括号里的内容。\n解析：最后一段括号里说，Every time any official in Beijing deliberately publicly about seeking an alternative to the U.S. dollar for the $2.1 trillion China holds in reserve, currency traders have a heart attack，“每当北京方面（中国政府）公开说要讲2.1万亿的美元储备换成其它货币储备是，货币交易这就吓得心惊胆战”，即货币交易这害怕的是中国更换外汇储备货币，故C选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"When Beijing allows its currency exchange rates to float."},{"option":2,"content":"When China starts to reduce its current foreign reserves."},{"option":3,"content":"When China talks about switching its dollar reserves to other currencies."},{"option":4,"content":"When Beijing mentions in public the huge debts America owes China."}]},{"id":103139,"title":"What is the author’s purpose of writing the passage?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的the author’s purpose可知本题考查作者的写作目的，属于主旨题。\n解析：全文中作者一直在强调美国需要学习中国人的勤俭，文章最后一句说，If Americans saved more and spent less, consistently over time, they wouldn’t have to worry about all that，“如果美国人多存钱少花钱，久而久之，就不会有那样的担忧了”。即作者希望美国政府减少借债，降低赤字，故A选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"To urge the American government to cut deficits."},{"option":2,"content":"To encourage Chinese people to spend more."},{"option":3,"content":"To tell Americans not to worry about their economy."},{"option":4,"content":"To promote understanding between China and America."}]}]}]}
