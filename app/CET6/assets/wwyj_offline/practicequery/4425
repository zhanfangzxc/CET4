[19]They want to know if we’d be interested in sponsoring a tour they want to make to East Asia.\nM: East Asia? uhh… and how much are they hoping to get from us?\nW: Well, the letter mentions 20,000 pounds, but I don’t know if they might settle for us.\nM: Do they say what they would cover? Have they anything specific in mind?\nW: No, I think they are just asking all the firms in tongue for as much money as they think they’ll give.\nM: And we are worth 20, 000 pounds, right?\nW: It seems so.\nM: Very flattering. But I am not awfully happy with the idea. What we get out of it?\nW: [20]Oh, good publicity I suppose. So what I suggest is not that we just give them a sum of money, but that we offer to pay for something specific like travel or something, and that in return, we ask for our name to be printed prominently in the program, and that they give us free advertising space in it.\nM: But the travel bill would be enormous, and we could never manage that.\nW: I know. [21]But why don’t we offer to pay for the printing of the programmes ourselves on condition that on the front cover there's something like “This programme is presented with the compliments of Norland Electronics”, and free advertising of course.\nM: Good idea. Well, let’s get back to them and ask what the program they want will cost. Then we can see if we are interested or not.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20130601/20136(1)C1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102662,"title":"What do we learn about the South Theater Company?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n文章开头处tour … to East Asia“去东亚巡演”，与B选项tour East Asia构成视听一致，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is advertising electronic products."},{"option":2,"content":"It is planning to tour East Asia."},{"option":3,"content":"It is sponsoring a TV programme."},{"option":4,"content":"It is giving performances in town."}]},{"id":102663,"title":"What benefit does the woman say their firm can get by sponsoring the Theater Company?

[22]After last week's announcement that Phil Collins might give up touring because live concerts are ruining his voice, doctors are counseling stars about the dos and don'ts of voice care. Here in the studio today, we have Mr. Paul Phillips, an expert from the High Field Hospital. Paul, what advice would you give to singers facing voice problems?\nM: If pop singers have got voice problems, they really need to be more selective about where they work. They shouldn't work in smoky atmospheres. They also need to think about resting their voices after a show. Something else they need to be careful about is medicines. Aspirin, for example, singers should avoid aspirin. It thins the blood. [23]And if a singer coughs, this can result in the bruising of the vocal cords.\nW: And is it true that some singers use drugs before concerts to boost their voices when they have voice problems?\nM: Yes, this does happen on occasion. They are easily-available on the continent and they are useful if a singer has problems with his vocal cords and has to sing that night. But if they are taken regularly, they cause a thinning of the voice muscle. [24]Most pop singers suffer from three things: lack of training, overuse and abuse of the voice, especially when they are young. They have difficult lives. When they go on tour, they do a vast number of concerts, singing in smoky places.\nW: So, what would you advise the singers to do?\nM: Warm you voice up before a show and warm it down after.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20130601/20136(1)C2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102665,"title":"What does last week's announcement say about rock star, Phil Collins?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n女士说give up touring“放弃巡演”，与D选项give up concert tours构成视听一致。现场音乐会对嗓子造成了伤害，Phil Collins可能会放弃巡回演唱会，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He has been seeing doctors and counsellors."},{"option":2,"content":"He has found a new way to train his voice."},{"option":3,"content":"He was caught abusing drugs."},{"option":4,"content":"He might given up concert tours."}]},{"id":102666,"title":"What does Paul Philips say about aspirin?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n男士话中the bruising of the vocal cords“损伤声带”，与D选项do harm to singer’s vocal chords构成同义替换。Paul Philips说阿司匹林会对声带造成损害，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Singers may become addicted to it."},{"option":2,"content":"It helps singers warm themselves up."},{"option":3,"content":"Singers use it to stay away from colds."},{"option":4,"content":"It can do harm to singer’s vocal chords."}]},{"id":102667,"title":"What does Paul Philips say about young pop singers?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词Most后面lack of training“缺乏培训”，与B选项lack … training构成视听一致。Paul Philips说大多数流行歌手尤其是在他们年轻的时候缺乏培训，过度使用嗓子或用嗓方式不对，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They are eager to become famous."},{"option":2,"content":"Many lack professional training."},{"option":3,"content":"It can do harm to singers’ vocal chords."},{"option":4,"content":"They live a glamorous life."}]},{"id":102668,"title":"What are the speakers mainly talking about?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n文章开头处Rock stars … voice abuse“摇滚明星嗓音滥用的问题”，与C选项Voice problems among pop singers“流行歌手的嗓音问题”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Harm to singers done by smoky atmospheres."},{"option":2,"content":"Side effects of some common drugs."},{"option":3,"content":"Voice problems among pop singers."},{"option":4,"content":"Hardships experienced by many young singers."}]}]}]}
