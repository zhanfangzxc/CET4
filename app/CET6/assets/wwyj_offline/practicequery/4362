After graduating from college with degrees in chemistry and microbiology, she went to work at Gulf South Research Institute in Louisiana. [26]As part of her job, she conducted field research on toxic substances in the environment, often in minority communities located near large industrial polluters. She found many families were being exposed to high, sometimes deadly, levels of chemicals and other toxic substances, [27]but she was not allowed to make information public.\n    Frustrated by these restrictions, Subra left her job in 1981, created her own company, and has devoted the past two decades to helping people fight back against giant industrial polluters.\n    She works with families and community groups to conduct environmental tests, interpret test results, and organize for change. [28]Because of her efforts, dozens of toxic sites across the country have been cleaned up, and one chemical industry spokesperson calls her “a top gun for the environmental movement”.\n    How has Subra achieved all this? Partly through her scientific training, partly through her commitment to environmental justice. [29]But just as important is her ability to communicate with people through public speaking. \"Public speaking,\" she says, \"is the primary vehicle I use for reaching people.'' If you had asked Subra before 1981, “Do you see yourself as a major public speaker?” She would have laughed at the idea. Yet today she gives more than 100 presentations a year. Along the way she has lectured at Harvard, testified before the Congress, and addressed audiences in 40 states, as well as in Mexico, Canada and Japan.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/200912/200912P1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102693,"title":"What did Wilma Subra do as part of her job while working at Gulf South Research Institute?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n文章开头处field research“现场调查”，与D选项field research构成视听一致。作为工作的一部分，她对环境中的有毒物质进行现场调查研究，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"She taught chemistry and microbiology courses in a college."},{"option":2,"content":"She gave lectures on how to become a public speaker."},{"option":3,"content":"She helped families move away from industrial polluters."},{"option":4,"content":"She engaged in field research on environmental pollution."}]},{"id":102694,"title":"Why did Wilma Subra leave her job in 1981?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n原文中not allowed to make information public“不允许公开信息”和restrictions“限制”，与A选项restricted her from revealing her findings“限制她揭露她发现的事情”构成同义替换，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The job restricted her from revealing her findings."},{"option":2,"content":"The job posed a potential threat to her health."},{"option":3,"content":"She found the working conditions frustrating."},{"option":4,"content":"She was offered a better job in a minority community."}]},{"id":102695,"title":"What results have Wilma Subra’s efforts had in the past two decades?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词Because后面toxic sites … have been cleaned up“有毒物质场所已经被清理干净了”，与C选项toxic sites … have been cleaned up构成视听一致。文章说在她的努力下，全国范围内几十个有毒物质场所已经被清理干净了，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Some giant industrial polluters have gone out of business."},{"option":2,"content":"More environmental organizations have appeared."},{"option":3,"content":"Many toxic sites in America have been cleaned up."},{"option":4,"content":"More branches of her company have been set up."}]},{"id":102696,"title":"What does the speaker say has contributed to Wilma Subra’s success?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词But后面ability to communicate with people through public speaking“通过公开演讲与人交流的能力”，与B选项构成视听一致。Wilma Subra成功的一个重大因素是她通过公开演讲与人交流的能力，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Her widespread influence among members of Congress."},{"option":2,"content":"Her ability to communicate through public speaking."},{"option":3,"content":"Her rigorous training in delivering eloquent speeches."},{"option":4,"content":"Her lifelong commitment to domestic and global issues."}]}]},{"id":4688,"name":"2009.12 Passage Two","content":"    [30]One of the biggest challenges facing employers and educators today is the rapid advance of globalization. The market place is no longer national or regional, but extends to all corners of the world. And this requires a global-ready workforce. Universities have a large part to play in preparing students for the 21st century labor market by promoting international educational experiences. The most obvious way universities can help develop global workforce is by encouraging students to study abroad as part of their course. Students who have experienced another culture first hand are more likely to be global-ready when they graduate.\n    Global workforce development doesn’t always have to involve travel abroad, however. If students learn another language and study other cultures, they will be more global-ready when they graduate. [31]It is important to point out that students also need to have a deep understanding of their own culture before they can begin to observe, analyze and evaluate other cultures. In multi-cultural societies, people can study each other’s cultures to develop intercultural competencies, such as critical and reflective thinking, and intellectual flexibility. This can be done both through the curriculum and through activities on campus outside of the classroom, such as art exhibitions and lectures from international experts. Many universities are already embracing this challenge, and providing opportunities for students to become global citizens. [32]Students themselves, however, may not realize that when they graduate, they will be competing in a global labor market. And universities need to raise awareness of these issues amongst undergraduates.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/200912/200912P2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102697,"title":"What is one of the biggest challenges facing employers and educators today?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词biggest后面rapid advance of globalization“全球化的快速发展”，与C选项accelerated pace of globalisation“全球化的加速步伐”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The fierce competition in the market."},{"option":2,"content":"The growing necessity of staff training."},{"option":3,"content":"The accelerated pace of globalisation."},{"option":4,"content":"The urgent need of a diverse workforce."}]},{"id":102698,"title":"What should students do first before they can really understand other cultures?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词also后面a deep understanding of their own culture“对自己文化的深刻理解”，与A选项a deep understanding of their own culture构成视听一致。在学生能开始观察、分析和评论其他文化之前，他们需要深刻理解他们自己的文化，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Gain a deep understanding of their own culture."},{"option":2,"content":"Take courses of foreign languages and cultures."},{"option":3,"content":"Share the experiences of people from other cultures."},{"option":4,"content":"Participate in international exchange programmes."}]},{"id":102699,"title":"What should college students realize according to the speaker?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词however后面they will be competing in a global labor market“他们将在全球劳动力市场中竞争”，与B选项Labor market is getting globalised“劳动力市场正在全球化”构成同义替换，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Reflective thinking is becoming critical."},{"option":2,"content":"Labor market is getting globalised."},{"option":3,"content":"Knowing a foreign language is essential."},{"option":4,"content":"Globalisation will eliminate many jobs."}]}]},{"id":4691,"name":"2009.12 Passage Three","content":"    To see if hair color affects a person’s chances of getting a job, researchers at California State University asked 136 college students to review the resume and photograph of a female applicant for a job as an accountant. Each student was given the same resume. But the applicant’s picture was altered, so that in some photos her hair was golden, in some red and in some brown. The result? [33]With brown hair, the woman was rated  more  capable, and she was offered a higher salary than when she had golden or red hair. Other studies have found similar results. Many respondents rate women with golden hair with less intelligence than other people, and red heads as more temperamental. Women with red or golden hair are victims of the common practice of stereotyping. \n    A stereotype is a simplistic or exaggerated image that humans carry in their minds about groups of people. [34]For example, “lawyers are shrewd and dishonest” is a popular stereotype. Stereotyping can occur in public speaking classes. When trying to choose a speech topic, some males think that women are uninterested in how to repair cars, while some females think that men are uninterested in creative hobbies, such as knitting and needle point. [35]We should reject stereotypes, because they force all people in a group into the same simple pattern. They fail to account for individual differences, and the wide range of characteristics among members of any group. Some lawyers are dishonest, yes, but many are not. Some women are uninterested in repairing cars, yes, but some are enthusiastic mechanics.
