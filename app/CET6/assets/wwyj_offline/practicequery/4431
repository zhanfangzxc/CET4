How about you?\nW: You can probably tell just by looking at me. I'm really busy. Hey, what are you reading?\nM: A pretty interesting article. My biology professor assigned it, and I thought I just look it over. But I got really involved in it. It's about endangered species. \nW: That sounds pretty interesting. I'm getting frustrated with the two research papers I'm struggling with. And can you believe they are both due on the same day?\nM: That's tough.\nW: I'll get through it. So what's this you are reading?\nM: [19]Well, it's basically about the choices conservationists are faced with. You know, these days when funding is so hard to come by. \nW: Wait a minute. Is the focus on biology or economics?\nM: Both. [20]Conservationists don't have enough funding to save every endangered species in the world, so they have to decide based on what would be lost if a species became extinct.\nW: Can you give me an example of what you mean?\nM: Take for instance, two animals, the spotted owl and the tailed toad. The article says the toad is unique. It has no relatives. But there are a lot of varieties of owls.\nW: [21]So, if that toad became extinct, we'd lose an important link in the chain of evolution, right?\nM: Exactly. But that isn't so for the owl. So for conservationists, it might be a clear choice of which animal to save.\nW: I see. I am glad I don't have to make that kind of decision.

I'm glad to continue the topic about music. [22]It is common knowledge that music can have a powerful effect on our emotions. In fact, since 1930s, music therapists have relied on music to soothe patients and help control pain. [23]Now psychologists are confirming that music can also help relieve depression and improve concentration.\nW: That's nice. Do they have any concrete examples?\nM: For instance, in a recent study, 15 surgeons were given some highly stressed math problems to solve. They were divided into three groups: one worked in silence; and in another, the surgeons listened to music of their choice on headphones; the third listened to classic music chosen by the researchers.\nW: What're the results?\nM: The results of the study may surprise you. [24]The doctors who got to choose their music experienced less stress and scored better than the others.\nW: That is surprising. How to explain this?\nM: One possible explanation is that listening to music you like stimulates the Alfa-wave in the brain, increases the heart rate and expands the breathing. That helps to reduce stress and sharpen concentration.\nW: Is there any other research?\nM: Yes. Other research suggests a second relation between the music and the brain: by examining the students' blood after listening to a variety of classical music collections, the researchers found that some students showed a large increase in a chemical substance, [25]a natural pain reliever, in their blood, which can help soothe the patient.\nW: Well, thank you so much for being with us today and having us know about another function of music.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20130603/20136(3)C2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102679,"title":"What is the talk mainly about?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n文章开头处powerful effect on our emotions“对人的情绪有强大的影响”，soothe patients …control pain“安慰病人和抑制疼痛”，与C选项benefits of music“音乐的好处”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Training given to music therapists."},{"option":2,"content":"How music prevents disease."},{"option":3,"content":"Studies on the benefits of music."},{"option":4,"content":"How musicians create music."}]},{"id":102680,"title":"According to the speaker, how is the music therapy currently used in medicine?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n男士话中relieve depression“缓解压抑”，与D选项relieve depression构成视听一致。男士说现在心理学家证实音乐可以帮助缓解压抑，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"In place of physical therapy."},{"option":2,"content":"To control brain problems."},{"option":3,"content":"To prevent heart disease."},{"option":4,"content":"To relieve depression."}]},{"id":102681,"title":"What did the study done with surgeons show?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词better than处scored better than the others“比其他人得分高”，与B选项solved problems better“问题解决得更加出色”构成同义替换，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They like to have music in the operating room."},{"option":2,"content":"They solved problems better while listening to music they liked."},{"option":3,"content":"They preferred classical music."},{"option":4,"content":"They performed better when they used headphones."}]},{"id":102682,"title":"What effect did music have in the study of students exposed to classic music?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n男士话中a natural pain reliever“天然的疼痛缓解物质”，与D选项a natural painkiller“天然的止痛剂”构成同义替换。男士说在听了大量古典音乐的学生的血液内产生了一种可以减轻疼痛的天然化学物质，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It increased the students’ white blood cell."},{"option":2,"content":"It increased some students’ energy level."},{"option":3,"content":"It improved the students’ ability to play musical instruments."},{"option":4,"content":"It released a natural painkiller in some students’ bodies."}]}]}]}
