Do you think it was necessary and fair to arrest Steve Bril?\nM: I don't know whether you realise that this man has been eating our park for five years.\nAnd he is encouraging other people to do the same thing every single day. [19]He has been organising groups to destroy our urban wildlife.\nW: But Mr. Stern, this situation has been going on happily for five years. Why do you suddenly decide to do something about it?\nM: Well, at first, we just thought he was an eccentric person, a bit odd, you know. [20]But over the years we came to realise that he is a dangerous guy. He has been ruining our city environment. Parks are to look at, not to eat. It's just as if you're going to allow people to walk through a zoo, and eat the baby bears.\nW: [21]But surely you or your park keepers, Mr. Stern, could have discouraged Mr. Bril from his activity without going to such drastic measures, without arresting him.\nM: Steve is a nice fellow, but what he is doing is illegal. He knows an awful lot about wild weeds. [22]We'll be very happy to let him organise tours if he just wouldn't eat the plant and wouldn't encourage other people to do so, too. You never know what this could lead to, all sorts of people ruining our park in all sorts of ways. This kind of thing is very definitely criminal behavior and must be stopped.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20121202/201212(2)C1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102655,"title":"What does the man say Steve Bril has been doing?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n男士话中destroy our urban wildlife“毁坏城市野生生物”，与B选项Destroying urban wildlife构成视听一致，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Damaging public facilities."},{"option":2,"content":"Destroying urban wildlife."},{"option":3,"content":"Organising rallies in the park."},{"option":4,"content":"Hurting baby animals in the zoo."}]},{"id":102656,"title":"Why was Steve Bril not arrested years ago?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词But后面over the years we came to realise that he is a dangerous guy“经过这么多年才发现他是个危险的人”，与C选项serious consequences of his doings were not fully realised“没有意识到…的危险后果”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He had bribed the park keepers to keep quiet."},{"option":2,"content":"People had differing opinions about his behaviour."},{"option":3,"content":"The serious consequences of his doings were not fully realised."},{"option":4,"content":"His behaviour was thought to have resulted from mental illness."}]},{"id":102657,"title":"What does the woman think of the action taken against Steve Bril?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词without后面drastic measures“严厉的措施”，与C选项Too harsh“太严厉”构成同义替换。女士认为对Steve Bril的处理过于严格，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Brutal."},{"option":2,"content":"Justifiable."},{"option":3,"content":"Too harsh."},{"option":4,"content":"Well-deserved."}]},{"id":102658,"title":"What finally led to Steve Bril's arrest?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词if和just后面wouldn't eat the plant and wouldn't encourage other people to do so“不吃野生生物以及不怂恿他人这么做”，与A选项Encouraging others to follow his wrong-doing“怂恿他人做同类违法恶行”构成同义替换，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Encouraging others to follow his wrong-doing."},{"option":2,"content":"Stealing endangered animals from the zoo."},{"option":3,"content":"Organising people against the authorities."},{"option":4,"content":"Attacking the park keepers in broad daylight."}]}]},{"id":4650,"name":"2012.12 (Conversation Two 卷二)","content":"M: Mary, are your children still at school?\nW:Yes, my eldest boy, Martin, left school last year.
