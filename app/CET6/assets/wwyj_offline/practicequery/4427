Unemployment in January jumped to a 16-year high of 7.6 percent, as 598,000 jobs were slashed from US payrolls in the worst single-month decline since December, 1974. With 1.8 million jobs lost in the last three months, there is urgent desire to boost the economy as quickly as possible. But Washington would do well to take a deep breath before reacting to the grim numbers.\n    Collectively, we rely on the unemployment figures and other statistics to frame our sense of reality. They are a vital part of an array of data that we use to assess if we’re doing well or doing badly, and that in turn shapes government policies and corporate budgets and personal spending decisions. The problem is that the statistics aren’t an objective measure of reality; they are simply a best approximation. Directionally, they capture the trends, but the idea that we know precisely how many are unemployed is a myth. That makes finding a solution all the more difficult.\n     First, there is the way the data is assembled. The official unemployment rate is the product of a telephone survey of about 60,000 homes. There is another survey, sometimes referred to as the “payroll survey,” that assesses 400,000 businesses based on their reported payrolls. Both survey have problems. The payroll survey can easily double-count someone: if you are one person with two jobs, you know up as two workers. The payroll survey also doesn’t capture the number of self-employed, and so says little about how many people are generating an independent income.\n    The household survey has a larger problem. When asked straightforwardly., people tend to lie or shade the truth when the subject is sex, money or employment. If you get a call and are asked if you’re employed, and you say yes, you’re employed. If you say no, however, it may surprise you to learn that you are only unemployed if you’ve been actively looking for work in the past four weeks; otherwise, you are “marginally attached to the labor force ” and not actually unemployed.\n    The urge to quantify is embedded in our society. But the idea that statisticians can then capture an objective reality isn’t just impossible. It also leads to serious misjudgments. Democrats and Republicans can and will take sides on a number of issues, but a more crucial concern is that both are basing major policy decisions on guesstimates rather than looking at the vast wealth of raw data with a critical eye and an open mind.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103150,"title":"What do we learn from the first paragraph?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干the first paragraph定位到文章第一段。\n解析：前两句指出来自劳工统计局的报告正如预料的那样糟糕，Unemployment in January jumped to a 16-year high of 7.6 percent，“失业率在一月份达到了16年来的最高水平”。反应出经济的下滑，政府需要尽快重振经济，故A选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The US economic situation is going from bad to worse."},{"option":2,"content":"Washington is taking drastic measures to provide more jobs."},{"option":3,"content":"The US government is slashing more jobs from its payrolls."},{"option":4,"content":"The recent economic crisis has taken the US by surprise."}]},{"id":103151,"title":"What does the author think of the unemployment figures and other statistics?","textExplain":"定位：由题干的unemployment figures and other statistics定位到第二段第一句。\n解析：定位句说我们依赖统计数据。本段第三句说The problem is that the statistics aren’t an objective measure of reality，“问题是数据并不是事实的客观衡量标准”。即统计数据不能完全反应现实，故D选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They form a solid basis for policy making."},{"option":2,"content":"They represent the current situation."},{"option":3,"content":"They signal future economic trends."},{"option":4,"content":"They do not fully reflect the reality."}]},{"id":103152,"title":"One problem with the payroll survey is that __________.","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的problem和payroll survey定位到第三段第四、五、六句。\n解析：定位句说两种调查都有问题，工资单调查的问题在于很容易把同时做多个工作的人“重复计算”，并且无法获知个体经营者的数量。即工资单调查的问题之一是不能计算个体经营者的数量，故B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"it does not included all the businesses"},{"option":2,"content":"it fails to count in the self-employed"},{"option":3,"content":"it magnifies the number of the jobless"},{"option":4,"content":"it does not treat all companies equally"}]},{"id":103153,"title":"The household survey can be faulty in that __________.","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的household survey和faulty定位到第四段。\n解析：事实细节题。该段一、二句指出，家庭调查有个更大的问题：When asked straightforwardly, people tend to lie or shade the truth when the subject is sex, money or employment，“当被直接询问的时候，如果话题涉及性、钱和工作，人们通常会选择撒谎或者遮掩事实”。即人们不提供真实信息，故C选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"people tend to lie when talking on the phone"},{"option":2,"content":"not everybody is willing or ready to respond"},{"option":3,"content":"some people won’t provide truthful information"},{"option":4,"content":"the definition of unemployment is too broad"}]},{"id":103154,"title":"At the end of the passage, the author suggests that __________.","textExplain":"定位：根据题干定位到文章最后一段。\n解析：最后一句说，一个更关键的问题在于民主党和共和党的重大决策都是基于猜测，而非基于批评的眼光性和开放的思维来看待失业率等数据。即决策者应该用批判的眼光和开放的思维看待失业率等数据，故B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"statisticians improve their data assembling methods"},{"option":2,"content":"decision makers view the statistics with a critical eye"},{"option":3,"content":"politicians listen more before making policy decisions"},{"option":4,"content":"Democrats and Republicans cooperate on crucial issues"}]}]},{"id":5121,"name":"2013.6 (Passage Two 卷一)","content":"    At some point in 2008,someone,probably in either Asia or Africa,made the decision to move from the countryside to the city.This nameless person pushed the human race over a historic threshold,for it was in that year that mankind became,for the first time in its history,a predominantly urban species.\n    It is a trend that shows no sign of slowing.Demographers reckon that three-quarters of humanity could be city-dwelling by 2050,with most of the increase coming int fast-growing towns of Asia and Africa.Migrants to cities are attracted by plentiful jobs,access to hospitals and education,and the ability to escape the boredom of a farmer’s agricultural life.Those factors are more than enough to make up for the squalor(肮脏),disease and spectacular poverty that those same migrants must often at first endure when they become urban dwellers.\n    It is the city that inspires the latest book from Peter Smith.His main thesis is that the buzz of urban life,and the opportunities it offers for com-operation and collaboration,is what attracts people to the city which in turn makes cities into the engines of art,commerce,science and progress.This is hardly revolutionary,but it is presented in a charming format. Mr.Smith has written a breezy guidebook,with a series of short chapters dedicated to specific aspects of urbanity-parks,say,or the various schemes that have been put forward over the years for building the perfect city.The result is a sort of high-quality,unusually rigorous coffee-table book,designed to be dipped into rather than read from beginning to end.\n    In the chapter on skyscrapers,forexample,Mr.Smith touches on construction methods,the revolutionary invention of the automatic lift,the practicalities of living in the sky and the likelihood that ,as cities become more crowded,apartment living will become the norm.But there is also time for brief diversions onto bizarre ground ,such as a discussion of the skyscraper index(which holds that a boom in skyscraper construction is foolproof sign of an imminent recession).\n    One obvious criticism is that the price of breadth is depth;many of Mr.Smith’s essays raise as many questions as they answer.Although that can indeed be frustration,this is probably the only way to treat so grand a topic.The city is the building block of civilisation and of almost everything people do;a guidebook to the city is really,therefore,a guidebook to how a large and ever-growing chunk of humanity chooses to live.Mr.Smith’s book serves as an excellent introduction to a vast subject,and will suggest plenty of further lines of inquiry.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103155,"title":"In what way is the year 2008 historic?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的the year 2008 定位到第一段。\n解析：第一段第二句说，This nameless person pushed the human race over a historic threshold, for it was in that year that mankind became, for the first time in its history, a predominantly urban species，“一个无名小卒做出移民的决定将人类推向了一个历史性的关点，在那一年人类在历史上第一次成为城市占主要地位的群体”，即在2008年城市人口数量超越农村人口数量，故A选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"For the first time in history,urban people outnumbered rural people."},{"option":2,"content":"An influential figure decided to move from the countryside to the city."},{"option":3,"content":"It is in this year that urbanisation made a start in Asia and Africa."},{"option":4,"content":"The population increase in cities reached a new peak in Asia and Africa."}]},{"id":103156,"title":"What does the author say about urbanisation?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的urbanisation定位到第一、二段。\n解析：文中第一段提出城市化这个话题，第二段第一句说It is a trend that shows no sign of slowing，“这个趋势没有减缓的迹象”，故B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Its impact is not easy to predict."},{"option":2,"content":"Its process will not slow down."},{"option":3,"content":"It is a milestone in human progress."},{"option":4,"content":"It aggravates the squalor of cities."}]},{"id":103157,"title":"How does the author comment on Peter Smith’s new book?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的Peter Smith’s new book定位到第三段第三、四句。\n解析：作者对史密斯先生新书的评价，由第三段第三句中charming一词可知，作者认为新书提出的观点异常迷人；又由接下来第四句中的a breezy guidebook可知，作者认为本书是一本如沐春风的指导书，故D选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is but an ordinary coffee-table book."},{"option":2,"content":"It is flavoured with humourous stories."},{"option":3,"content":"It serves as a guide to arts and commerce."},{"option":4,"content":"It is written in a lively and interesting style."}]},{"id":103158,"title":"What does the author say in the chapter on skyscrapers?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的the chapter on skyscrapers定位到第四段。\n解析：第四段第一句说，史密斯先生在关于摩天大楼那一章，阐述了建筑方法、自动电梯等问题。该段第二句But之后谈及一些稀奇的理论，比如关于摩天大楼指数，即摩天大楼的建筑热很明显地预示着即将发生的萧条，故D选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The automatic lift is indispensable in skyscrapers."},{"option":2,"content":"People enjoy living in skyscrapers with a view."},{"option":3,"content":"Skyscrapers are a sure sign of a city’s prosperity."},{"option":4,"content":"Recession closely follows a skyscraper boom."}]},{"id":103159,"title":"What may be one criticism of Mr.Smith’s book?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的criticism定位到文章最后一段第一句。\n解析：定位句说，One obvious criticism is that the price of breadth is depth;many of Mr.Smith’s essays raise as many questions as they answer，“对史密斯先生的书的一个显著批评是：文章涉及内容过于广泛；史密斯先生文章回答许多问题的同时有引出了同样多的问题”，即宽度很广，但深度不够，故C选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It does not really touch on anything serious."},{"option":2,"content":"It is too long for people to read from cover to cover."},{"option":3,"content":"It does not deal with any aspect of city life in depth."},{"option":4,"content":"It fails to provide sound advice to city dwellers."}]}]}]}
