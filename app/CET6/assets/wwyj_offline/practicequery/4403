That's partially because it appears people who set realistic goals actually work more efficiently, and exert more effort, to achieve those goals.\n    What's far less understood by scientists, however, are the potentially harmful effects of goal-setting.\n　Newspapers relay daily accounts of goal-setting prevalent in industries and businesses up and down both Wall Street and Main Street , yet there has been surprisingly little research on how the long-trumpeted practice of setting goals may have contributed to the current economic crisis , and unethical (不道德的)behavior in general.\n　“ Goals are widely used and promoted as having really beneficial effects. And yet, the same motivation that can push people to exert more effort in a constructive way could also motivate people to be more likely to engage in unethical behaviors,” says Maurice Schweitzer, an associate professor at Penn’s Wharton School.\n　\" It turns out there’s no economic benefit to just having a goal—you just get a psychological benefit,” Schweitzer says. “ But in many cases, goals have economic rewards that make them more powerful.”\n　A prime example Schweitzer and his colleagues cite is the 2004 collapse of energy-trading giant Enron, where managers used financial incentives to motivate salesmen to meet specific revenue goals. The problem, Schweitzer says, is the actual trades were not profitable.\n　Other studies have shown that saddling employees with unrealistic goals can compel them to lie, cheat or steal. Such was the case in the early 1990s when Sears imposed a sales quota on its auto repair staff. It prompted employees to overcharge for work and to complete unnecessary repairs on a companywide basis.\n　Schweitzer concedes his research runs counter to a very large body of literature that commends the many benefits of goal-setting. Advocates of the practice have taken issue with his team’s use of such evidence as news accounts to support his conclusion that goal-setting is widely over-prescribed.\n　In a rebuttal (反驳) paper, Dr. Edwin Locke writes: “Goal-setting is not going away. Organizations cannot thrive without being focused on their desired end results any more than an individual can thrive without goals to provide a sense of purpose.”\n　But Schweitzer contends the “mounting causal evidence” linking goal-setting and harmful behavior should be studied to help spotlight issues that merit caution and further investigation. “Even a few negative effects could be so large that they outweigh many positive effects,” he says.\n    “Goal-setting does help coordinate and motivate people. My idea would be to combine that with careful oversight, a strong organizational culture, and make sure the goals that you use are going to be constructive and not significantly harm the organization,” Schweitzer says.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103120,"title":"What message does the author try to convey about goal-setting?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中author和goal-setting定位到第二段。\n解析：定位句说，What's far less understood by scientists, however, are the potentially harmful effects of goal-setting，“科学家们对目标设定的潜在不良影响知之甚少”，即科学家们忽视了目标设定的危害，即D选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The goal increase people’s work efficiency."},{"option":2,"content":"The goals most people set are unrealistic."},{"option":3,"content":"Its role has been largely underestimated."},{"option":4,"content":"Its negative effects have long been neglected."}]},{"id":103121,"title":"What does Maurice Schweitzer want to show by citing the example of Enron?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中citing the example of和Enron定位到第六段第一句话。\n解析：定位句说，A prime example Schweitzer and his colleagues cite is the 2004 collapse of energy-trading giant Enron, where managers used financial incentives to motivate salesmen to meet specific revenue goals，“一个重要的例子是能源巨头安然公司关闭，其管理者运用经济奖励来激励销售人员以达到特定的收入目标”。这个例子说明的就是第五段最后一句话，But in many cases, goals have economic rewards that make them more powerful，“在很多情况下，具有经济回报的目标会让这些目标变得更强大”，故A选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Goals with financial rewards have strong motivational power."},{"option":2,"content":"Setting realistic goals can turn a failing business into success."},{"option":3,"content":"Financial incentives ensure companies meet specific revenue goals."},{"option":4,"content":"Businesses are less likely to succeed without setting realistic goals."}]},{"id":103122,"title":"How did Sears’ goal-setting affect its employees?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中Sears’ 和employees定位到第七段最后两句话。\n解析：定位句说，可知Sears公司强加给汽修人员销售定额的做法，使公司员工普遍存在收费过高和追加不必要的维修项目等问题。即采取非道德手段完成业绩，故B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They competed with one another to attract more customers."},{"option":2,"content":"They resorted to unethical practice to meet their sales quota."},{"option":3,"content":"They were obliged to work more hours to increase their sales."},{"option":4,"content":"They improved their customer service on a companywide basis."}]},{"id":103123,"title":"What do advocates of goal-setting think of Schweitzer’s research?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中advocates 定位到第八段第二句话。\n解析：定位句说Advocates of the practice have taken issue with his team’s use of such evidence as news accounts to support his conclusion that goal-setting is widely over-prescribed，“（目标设定）行为的支持者们对Schweitzer团队使用新闻报道来支持自己的结论这一行为提出了异议”。第九段Dr. Edwin Locke写文章反驳说没有目标设定就会出现很多问题，由此可知目标设定行为的支持者们不认同Schweitzer的研究，故B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It runs counter to the existing literature on the subject."},{"option":2,"content":"Its conclusion is not based on solid scientific evidence."},{"option":3,"content":"It exaggerates the side effects of goal-setting."},{"option":4,"content":"Its findings are not of much practical value."}]},{"id":103124,"title":"What is Schweitzer’s contention against Edwin Locke?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中Schweitzer’s contention定位到倒数第二段第一句。\n解析：定位句说，But Schweitzer contends the “mounting causal evidence” linking goal-setting and harmful behavior should be studied to help spotlight issues that merit caution and further investigation，“Schweitzer主张应该对不断增加的因果证据给予研究，从而突显出一些值得进一步调查的问题”。即Schweitzer认为有因果证据证明目标设定导致伤害性结果，需要被仔细研究，故A选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Studying goal-setting can throw more light on successful business practices."},{"option":2,"content":"The link between goal-setting and harmful behavior deserves further study."},{"option":3,"content":"The positive effects of goal-setting outweigh its negative effects."},{"option":4,"content":"Goal-setting has become too deep-rooted in corporate culture."}]}]},{"id":5091,"name":"2012.6 Passage Two","content":"    For most of the 20th century, Asia asked itself what it could learn from the modern, innovating West. Now the question must be reversed: what can the West’s overly indebted and sluggish (经济滞长的) nations learn from a flourishing Asia?\n　Just a few decades ago, Asia’s two giants were stagnating(停滞不前) under faulty economic ideologies. However, once China began embracing free-market reforms in the 1980s, followed by India in the 1990s, both countries achieved rapid growth. Crucially, as they opened up their markets, they balanced market economy with sensible government direction. As the Indian economist Amartya Sen has wisely said, “The invisible hand of the market has often relied heavily on the visible hand of government.”\n　Contrast this middle path with America and Europe, which have each gone ideologically overboard in their own ways. Since the 1980s, America has been increasingly clinging to the ideology of uncontrolled free markets and dismissing the role of government—following Ronald Regan’s idea that “government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. “Of course, when the markets came crashing down in 2007, it was decisive government intervention that saved the day. Despite this fact, many Americans are still strongly opposed to “ big government.”\n　If Americans could only free themselves from their antigovernment doctrine, they would begin to see that the America’s problems are not insoluble. A few sensible federal measures could put the country back on the right path. A simple consumption tax of, say, 5% would significantly reduce the country’s huge government deficit without damaging productivity. A small gasoline tax would help free America from its dependence on oil imports and create incentives for green energy development. In the same way, a significant reduction of wasteful agricultural subsidies could also lower the deficit. But in order to take advantage of these common-sense solutions, Americans will have to put aside their own attachment to the idea of smaller government and less regulation. American politicians will have to develop the courage to follow what is taught in all American public-policy schools: that there are good taxes and bad taxes. Asian countries have embraced this wisdom, and have built sound long-term fiscal (财政的) policies as a result.\n    Meanwhile, Europe has fallen prey to a different ideological trap: the belief that European governments would always have infinite resources and could continue borrowing as if there were no tomorrow. Unlike the Americans, who felt that the markets knew best, the Europeans failed to anticipate how the markets would react to their endless borrowing. Today, the European Union is creating a $580 billion fund to ward off sovereign collapse. This will buy the EU time, but it will not solve the bloc’s larger problem.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103125,"title":"What has contributed to the rapid economic growth in China and India?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中growth in China and India定位到第二段第二、三句话。.\n解析：定位句说，However, once China began embracing free-market reforms in the 1980s, followed by India in the 1990s, both countries achieved rapid growth. “中国在20世纪80年代开始推行自由市场改革，印度在90年代紧跟其后，两国均实现了快速的增长”。后面一句说，Crucially, as they opened up their markets, they balanced market economy with sensible government direction，“至关重要的是，随着市场的开放，他们在市场经济和政府导向之间取得了平衡”。即市场经济和政府调控是中印经济快速发展的原因，故D选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Timely reform of government at all levels."},{"option":2,"content":"Heavy reliance on the hand of government."},{"option":3,"content":"Copying western-style economic behavior."},{"option":4,"content":"Free market plus government intervention."}]},{"id":103126,"title":"What does Ronald Reagan mean by saying “government is the problem” (line4, Para. 3)?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中Ronald Reagan定位到第三段第二句话。\n解析：定位句说，Since the 1980s, America has been increasingly clinging to the ideology of uncontrolled free markets and dismissing the role of government—following Ronald Regan’s idea that “government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem，“可知20世纪80年代以来，美国从上世纪80年代已经越来越迷恋于无约束的自由市场思维，李根总统说政府不能解决问题，政府本身就是个问题”。由此可知，美国人认为政府会阻碍经济发展，即B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Government action is key to solving economic problems."},{"option":2,"content":"Government regulation hinders economic development."},{"option":3,"content":"Many social ills are caused by wrong government policies."},{"option":4,"content":"Many social problems arise from government’s inefficiency."}]},{"id":103127,"title":"What stopped the American economy from collapsing in 2007?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中2007定位到第三段第三句话\n解析：定位句说，when the markets came crashing down in 2007, it was decisive government intervention that saved the day，“当市场经济在2007年轰然崩溃时，正是果断的政府干预扭转了局面”，故B选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Abandonment of big government by the public."},{"option":2,"content":"Effective measures adopted by the government."},{"option":3,"content":"Self-regulatory repair mechanisms of the free market."},{"option":4,"content":"Cooperation between the government and businesses."}]},{"id":103128,"title":"What is the author’s suggestion to the American public in face of the public government deficit?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中suggestion to the American public和deficit定位到第四段倒数第三句话。\n解析：定位句说，But in order to take advantage of these common-sense solutions, Americans will have to put aside their own attachment to the idea of smaller government and less regulation，“要利用这些常识性的解决方案，美国人必须要把自己对更小政府、更少调控这种想法的笃信放到一边”，即D选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They develop green energy to avoid dependence on oil import."},{"option":2,"content":"They urge the government to revise its existing public policies."},{"option":3,"content":"They put up with the inevitable sharp increase of different taxes."},{"option":4,"content":"They give up the idea of smaller government and less regulation."}]},{"id":103129,"title":"What’s the problem with the European Union?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中European Union定位到第五段第一句话。\n解析：定位句说，Europe has fallen prey to a different ideological trap: the belief that European governments would always have infinite resources and could continue borrowing as if there were no tomorrow，“欧洲落入了另一个意识形态陷阱：相信欧洲各国政府总有无限的资源，能像没有明天一样持续借贷”。可见，欧盟的问题在于借贷过多，即D选项为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Conservative ideology."},{"option":2,"content":"Shrinking market."},{"option":3,"content":"Lack of resources."},{"option":4,"content":"Excessive borrowing."}]}]}]}
