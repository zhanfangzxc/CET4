Of course, the conditions of work are very different: The Polytechnic is offering a two-year contract which could be renewed, but the Language School is only offering a year’s contract, and that’s a different minus. It could be renewed, but you never know.\nW: I see. So it’s much less secure. But you don’t need to think too much about steady jobs when you are only 23.\nM: That’s true.\nW: What about the salaries?\nM: Well, the Pistoia job pays much better in the short term. I’ll be getting the equivalent of about ￡22 000 a year there, but only ￡20 000 at the Polytechnic. But then the hours are different. At the Polytechnic, I’d have to do 35 hours a week, 20 teaching and 15 administrations, whereas the Pistoia School is only asking for 30 hours’ teaching.\nW: Hmm…\nM: Then the type of teaching is so different. [20]The Polytechnic’s is all adults and mostly preparation for exams like the Cambridge certificates. The Language School wants me to do a bit exam preparation, but also quite a lot of work in companies and factories and a couple of children’s classes. Oh, and a bit of literature teaching.\nW: [21]Well, that sounds very much more varied and interesting. And I’d imagine you’d be doing quite a lot of teaching outside the school and moving around quite a bit.\nM: Yes, whereas with the Polytechnic’s position, I’d be stuck in the school all day.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/201006/20106C1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102068,"title":"What do we learn about the man from the conversation?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n女士话中not sure which to go for“不确定该选择哪份工作”，与C选项undecided as to which job to go for构成同义替换。女士问男士是不是无法确定该选择哪份工作，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He wants to sign a long-term contract."},{"option":2,"content":"He is good at both language and literature."},{"option":3,"content":"He is undecided as to which job to go for."},{"option":4,"content":"He prefers teaching to administrative work."}]},{"id":102069,"title":"What do we learn about the students at the Polytechnic?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n男士话中all adults“都是成年人”，与A选项all adults构成视听一致。男士说Polytechnic的学生都是成年人，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They are all adults."},{"option":2,"content":"They hate exams."},{"option":3,"content":"The all plan to study in Cambridge."},{"option":4,"content":"They are going to work in companies."}]},{"id":102070,"title":"What does the woman think of the job at the Language School?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词much more后面varied and interesting“多样化且有趣”，与D选项Varied and interesting构成视听一致。女士说Language School的工作更加多样化，也更有趣，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Difficult but rewarding."},{"option":2,"content":"Time-consuming and tiring."},{"option":3,"content":"Demanding and frustrating."},{"option":4,"content":"Varied and interesting."}]}]},{"id":4063,"name":"2011.6 Conversation One","content":"W: You know I've often wondered why people laugh at the picture of a big belly businessman slipping on a banana skin and falling on his bottom.

[19]What he tried to do was to teach a male dolphin called Bass and a female called Doris to communicate with each other across a solid barrier.\nM: So how did he do it exactly?\nW: Well, first of all, he kept the two dolphins together in the same tank and taught them to press levers whenever they saw a light. [20]The levers were fitted to the side of the tank next to each other. If the light flashed on and off several times, the dolphins were supposed to press the left-hand lever followed by the right-hand one. If the light was kept steady, the dolphins were supposed to press the levers in reverse order. Whenever they responded correctly, they were rewarded with fish.\nM: Sounds terribly complicated.\nW: Well, that was the first stage. In the second stage, Doctor Bastian separated the dolphins into two tanks. They could still hear one another, but they couldn’t actually see each other. [21]The levers and light were set up in exactly the same way except that this time it was only Doris who could see the light indicating which lever to press first. But in order to get their fish, both dolphins had to press the levers in the correct order. This meant of course that Doris had to tell Bass whether it was a flashing light or whether it was a steady light.\nM: So did it work?\nW: Well, amazingly enough, the dolphins achieved a 100 % success rate.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/201206/20126C1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102075,"title":"What is the purpose of Doctor Jarvis Bastian’s experiment?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n文章开头处communicate with each other“与彼此交流”，与D选项communicate with each other构成视听一致。女士指出Jarvis Bastian博士实验的目的是看海豚是否能够隔着障碍物彼此交流，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"To test how responsive dolphins are to various signals."},{"option":2,"content":"To examine how long it takes dolphins to acquire a skill."},{"option":3,"content":"To find out if the female dolphin is cleverer than the male one."},{"option":4,"content":"To see if dolphins can learn to communicate with each other."}]},{"id":102076,"title":"What were the dolphins supposed to do when they saw a steady light?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n女士话中press the left-hand lever followed by the right-hand one“先左边杠杆后右边杠杆”和in reverse order“相反顺序”，与A选项right-hand lever first“先右边杠杆”构成同义替换，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Press the right-hand lever first."},{"option":2,"content":"Produce the appropriate sound."},{"option":3,"content":"Raise their heads above the water."},{"option":4,"content":"Swim straight into the same tank."}]},{"id":102077,"title":"How did the second stage of the experiment differ from the first stage?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词it was … who和only 处it was only Doris who could see the light“只有Doris能够看到灯光指示信号”，与C选项Only one dolphin was able to see the light“只有一只海豚能够看到灯光指示信号”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Both dolphins were put in the same tank."},{"option":2,"content":"The male dolphin received more rewards."},{"option":3,"content":"Only one dolphin was able to see the light."},{"option":4,"content":"The lever was beyond the dolphins’ reach."}]}]},{"id":4069,"name":"2012.12 (Conversation Two 卷二)","content":"M: Mary, are your children still at school?\nW:Yes, my eldest boy, Martin, left school last year.
