I've got a long report I must dictate. Could I borrow your machine?\nM: Of course. But can you spare me a second? [19]It's the message you sent to me about delivery delay on the control desks. What's gone wrong?\nW: Everything, John. We have to get the steel sheets we need for these desks from new suppliers, while, the suppliers have got some trouble or other. [20]They say they will be a bit late for the delivery.\nM: But they can't be. These control desks are a special order. They are wanted for one of the big computer companies. It's a very important contract.\nW: When did it promise the delivery?\nM: On Thursday next week. And there's a penalty clause. We stand to lose 10 percent of our price for each week of overdue delivery.\nW: [21]Oh, these penalty clauses. Why did you sales people accept them?\nM: We have to accept them; otherwise, we don't get the contracts.\nW: Well, let's get on to the Buying Department. I already heard about the delay yesterday because we kept the production line clear to handle the special sheets. It's a dreadful nuisance.\nM: It will be more than a nuisance. If we don't meet on the delivery date, it will cost us a lot of money.\nW: Keep calm, John. [22]We can perhaps claim compensation from the steel suppliers for failure to deliver on time. Then we will settle the penalty clause.\nM: Well, if we can.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20130602/20136(2)C1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102669,"title":"Why did the woman send the message to the man?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n男士话中delivery delay“送货延迟”，与A选项inform … a problem“告知一个难题”构成同义替换。女士给男士发信息的目的就是想告诉男士他们碰到的难题，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"To inform him of a problem they face."},{"option":2,"content":"To request him to purchase control desks."},{"option":3,"content":"To discuss the content of a project report."},{"option":4,"content":"To ask him to fix the dictating machine."}]},{"id":102670,"title":"What does the woman say about the new suppliers?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n女士话中later for the delivery“送货迟到”，与C选项cannot deliver … on time“不能按时送到”构成同义替换。女士说供货商无法按时把货送到，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They quote the best price in the market."},{"option":2,"content":"They manufacture and sell office furniture."},{"option":3,"content":"They cannot deliver the steel sheets on time."},{"option":4,"content":"They cannot produce the steel sheets needed."}]},{"id":102671,"title":"How did the man get the contract?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n女士话中penalty clauses… accept“接受处罚性条款”，与B选项accepting the penalty clauses构成视听一致。男士拿到合约的前提条件是接受处罚性条款，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"By marking down the unit price."},{"option":2,"content":"By accepting the penalty clauses."},{"option":3,"content":"By allowing more time for delivery."},{"option":4,"content":"By promising better after-sales service."}]},{"id":102672,"title":"What does the woman suggest they do?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n对话结尾处claim compensation from the steel suppliers“对供货商提出赔偿要求”，与B选项“让”构成视听一致。女士建议他们可以让供货商承担没有按时供货的责任，对他们提出赔偿要求，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Give the customer a ten percent discount."},{"option":2,"content":"Claim compensation from the stool suppliers."},{"option":3,"content":"Ask the Buying Department to change suppliers."},{"option":4,"content":"Cancel the contract with the customer."}]}]},{"id":4664,"name":"2013.6 (Conversation Two 卷二)","content":"M: [25]Kathy, chaos theory seems to be a branch of physics or mathematics. [23]You are an economist, so how does it influence your work?\nW: Well, in several ways. I'm responsible for financial development programmes in many parts of the world, so forecasting long range trends and making predictions on the basis of present evidence is what I do. [24]Chaos theory was developed by scientists trying to explain the movement of the planets and the changes in environmental conditions. Both of these things are also about making long term predictions on the basis of present evidence.\nM: Are many economists involved in this field?\nW: An increasing number. In the 1990s, many economists began to look at chaos theory as a way of providing models for forecasting.\nM: What kind of \"models\" are we talking about here?\nW: Well, that's a good question, because the basic idea of chaos theory is that there aren't any \"models\" as such—there aren't guaranteed forms, but rather patterns of change in development.\nM: Doesn't that mean that forecasting is impossible?\nW: No, but it certainly makes it more of a challenge. Mandelbrot, who did the experiment with stock exchange prices, for example, noted that although the outcomes were variable, there were in fact certain constancy. What we have to do is make sure we know what these are and take into account all the possible variables.\nM: But do economics and finance work in the same way as weather conditions or the movement of planets?\nW: Well, no, of course not. There are certain underlying similarities. But we have to leave them for the other time.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/20130602/20136(2)C2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102673,"title":"What is the woman's profession?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n男士话中economist“经济学家”，与D选项Economist构成视听一致。男士问女士，作为一位经济学家，混沌理论对她的工作有什么影响，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Stockbroker."},{"option":2,"content":"Physicist."},{"option":3,"content":"Mathematician."},{"option":4,"content":"Economist."}]},{"id":102674,"title":"What was chaos theory supposed to do when it was first formulated?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n女士话中explain the movement of the planets and the changes in environmental conditions“解释行星的运动和环境的变化”，与B选项Explain certain natural phenomena“解释某些自然现象”构成同义替换，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Improve computer programming."},{"option":2,"content":"Explain certain natural phenomena."},{"option":3,"content":"Predict global population growth."},{"option":4,"content":"Promote national financial health."}]},{"id":102675,"title":"What are the speakers mainly talking about?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n对话开头处chaos theory“混沌理论”，与C选项Chaos theory构成视听一致。综合整篇对话的内容，两人谈论的是混沌理论及其应用，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Their different educational backgrounds."},{"option":2,"content":"Changing attitudes toward nature."},{"option":3,"content":"Chaos theory and its applications."},{"option":4,"content":"The current global economic crisis."}]}]}]}
