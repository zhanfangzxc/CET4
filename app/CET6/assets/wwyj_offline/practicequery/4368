Of course, the conditions of work are very different: The Polytechnic is offering a two-year contract which could be renewed, but the Language School is only offering a year’s contract, and that’s a different minus. It could be renewed, but you never know.\nW: I see. So it’s much less secure. But you don’t need to think too much about steady jobs when you are only 23.\nM: That’s true.\nW: What about the salaries?\nM: Well, the Pistoia job pays much better in the short term. I’ll be getting the equivalent of about ￡22 000 a year there, but only ￡20 000 at the Polytechnic. But then the hours are different. At the Polytechnic, I’d have to do 35 hours a week, 20 teaching and 15 administrations, whereas the Pistoia School is only asking for 30 hours’ teaching.\nW: Hmm…\nM: Then the type of teaching is so different. [20]The Polytechnic’s is all adults and mostly preparation for exams like the Cambridge certificates. The Language School wants me to do a bit exam preparation, but also quite a lot of work in companies and factories and a couple of children’s classes. Oh, and a bit of literature teaching.\nW: [21]Well, that sounds very much more varied and interesting. And I’d imagine you’d be doing quite a lot of teaching outside the school and moving around quite a bit.\nM: Yes, whereas with the Polytechnic’s position, I’d be stuck in the school all day.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/201006/20106C1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102613,"title":"What do we learn about the man from the conversation?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n女士话中not sure which to go for“不确定该选择哪份工作”，与C选项undecided as to which job to go for构成同义替换。女士问男士是不是无法确定该选择哪份工作，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He wants to sign a long-term contract."},{"option":2,"content":"He is good at both language and literature."},{"option":3,"content":"He is undecided as to which job to go for."},{"option":4,"content":"He prefers teaching to administrative work."}]},{"id":102614,"title":"What do we learn about the students at the Polytechnic?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n男士话中all adults“都是成年人”，与A选项all adults构成视听一致。男士说Polytechnic的学生都是成年人，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They are all adults."},{"option":2,"content":"They hate exams."},{"option":3,"content":"The all plan to study in Cambridge."},{"option":4,"content":"They are going to work in companies."}]},{"id":102615,"title":"What does the woman think of the job at the Language School?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词much more后面varied and interesting“多样化且有趣”，与D选项Varied and interesting构成视听一致。女士说Language School的工作更加多样化，也更有趣，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Difficult but rewarding."},{"option":2,"content":"Time-consuming and tiring."},{"option":3,"content":"Demanding and frustrating."},{"option":4,"content":"Varied and interesting."}]}]},{"id":4608,"name":"2010.6 Conversation Two","content":"W: [22]Good evening, and welcome to tonight’s edition of Legendary Lives.  Our subject this evening is James Dean, actor and hero for the young people of his time. Edward Murray is the author of a new biography of Dean. Good evening, Edward.\nM: Hello, Tina.\nW: Edward, tell us what you know about Dean's early life.\nM: He was born in Indiana in 1931, but his parents moved to California when he was five. [23]He wasn't there long, though, because his mother passed away just four years later. Jimmy's father sent him back to Indiana after that to live with his aunt.\nW: So how did he get into acting?\nM: Well, first he acted in plays at high school. [24]Then he went to college in California where he got seriously into acting. In 1951, he moved to New York to do more stage acting.\nW: Then when did his movie career really start?\nM: 1955. His first starring role was in East of Eden. It was fabulous. Dean became a huge success. But the movie that really made him famous was his second one, Rebel Without a Cause. That was about teenagers who felt like they didn't fit into society.\nW: So how many more movies did he make?\nM: Just one more. Then he died in a car crash in California in 1955.\nW: What a tragedy! He only made three movies! [25]So what made him the legend he still is today?\nM: Well I guess his looks, his acting ability, his short life and maybe the type of character he played in his movies. Many young people thought him as a symbol of American youths.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/201006/20106C2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102616,"title":"What is the woman doing?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n文章开头处Good evening and welcome to tonight’s …“晚上好，欢迎收看今晚的…”，与D选项Hosting a television show“主持电视节目”构成同义替换。由对话开始的欢迎词可知女士正在主持电视节目，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Reviewing a new biography."},{"option":2,"content":"Interviewing a movie star."},{"option":3,"content":"Discussing teenage role models."},{"option":4,"content":"Hosting a television show."}]},{"id":102617,"title":"Why did James Dean move back to Indiana when he was young?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词because后面his mother passed away“他妈妈过世了”，与B选项He lost his mother“他失去了妈妈”构成同义替换。Dean小时候又回到印第安纳是因为他妈妈去世了，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He had to attend school there."},{"option":2,"content":"He lost his mother."},{"option":3,"content":"He was unhappy in California."},{"option":4,"content":"He missed his aunt."}]},{"id":102618,"title":"What does the man say James Dean did at college in California?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n男士话中he got seriously into acting“他真正投入到了表演中”，与D选项构成视听一致。男士说Dean在加利福尼亚上了大学后，就真正投入到了表演中，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He played a role in East of Eden."},{"option":2,"content":"He delivered public speeches."},{"option":3,"content":"He hosted talk shows on TV."},{"option":4,"content":"He got seriously into acting."}]},{"id":102619,"title":"What do we know about James Dean from the conversation?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n文章结尾处legend“传奇”，与A选项legendary“传奇的”构成视听一致。女士问是什么使Dean直到今天仍是个传奇，说明Dean长久以来一直是个传奇人物，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He has long been a legendary figure."},{"option":2,"content":"He made numerous popular movies."},{"option":3,"content":"He was the most successful actor of his time."},{"option":4,"content":"He was best at acting in Hollywood tragedies."}]}]}]}
