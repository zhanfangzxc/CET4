We are to feel sorry for him.\nM: Actually, Laura, I think we laugh because we are glad it didn't happen to us. [19]But of course there is also a kind of humorous satisfaction in seeing somebody self-important making a fool of themselves.\nW: Yes, and there are a lot of jokes about people who are too fat or physically handicapped, you know, deaf, or short-sighted, things like that. After all, it's not really funny to be like that.\nM: [20]Oh, I think that's because we're embarrassed. We don't know how to cope with the situation. Perhaps we are even a bit frightened we might get like that, so we laugh. What about the custard pie routine?\nW: What do you mean “custard pie routine”?\nM: Oh,you know, all those old films where someone gets so outraged with his boss, he picks up a custard pie and plasters it all over the other person's face.\nW: That never makes me laugh very much, because you can guess what's going to happen. But a lot of people still find it laughable. [21]It must be because it’s the sort of the thing we'd all love to do once in a while and never quiet have the courage to.\nM: I had an old aunt who used to throw cups of tea at people when she was particularly irritated. [22]She said it relieved her feelings.\nW: It must have come a bit expensive.\nM: Not really. She took care never to throw her best china.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET6_new_audio/201106/20116C1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102627,"title":"Why does the man say we laughed when we see some self-important people making fool of themselves?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词But后面humorous satisfaction“幽默的满足感”，与C选项humorous satisfaction构成视听一致。男士说人们见到自我感觉良好的人出洋相时会有一种幽默的满足感，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"We simply cannot help reacting instinctively that way."},{"option":2,"content":"We wish to hide our indifference to their misfortune."},{"option":3,"content":"We derive some humorous satisfaction from their misfortune."},{"option":4,"content":"We think it serves them right for being mean to other people."}]},{"id":102628,"title":"Why do some people joke about those who are fat or handicapped according to the man?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词because后面don't know how to cope with the situation“不知道如何应对这种情况”，与C选项构成视听一致。我们开玩笑的原因是不知道该如何应这种情况，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They want to show their genuine sympathy."},{"option":2,"content":"They have had similar personal experiences."},{"option":3,"content":"They don't know how to cope with the situation."},{"option":4,"content":"They don't want to reveal their own frustration."}]},{"id":102629,"title":"Why do many people find it funny to see someone throwing a custard pie on their bosses’ face?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词must和because后面love to do … and never quiet have the courage to“想做而不敢做”，与A选项would like to do it but don't dare to构成同义替换。女士说人们认为向老板脸上扔蛋糕的行为好笑，是因为我们都曾想做这种事情，但却从未有胆量去做，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They themselves would like to do it but don't dare to."},{"option":2,"content":"It's an opportunity for relieving their tension."},{"option":3,"content":"It's a rare chance for them to see the boss lose face."},{"option":4,"content":"They have seen this many times in old films."}]},{"id":102630,"title":"Why did the man’s aunt say she would throw cups of tea at people occasionally?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n文章结尾处relieved her feelings“发泄情绪”，与C选项构成视听一致。男士说生气时向对方扔茶杯可以发泄情绪，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"To irritate them."},{"option":2,"content":"To each them a lesson."},{"option":3,"content":"To relieve her feelings."},{"option":4,"content":"To show her courage."}]}]},{"id":4622,"name":"2011.6 Conversation Two","content":"W: Your name is Sanjay Kumar, is that correct?\nM: Yes, madam.\nW: You claim you are traveling on a scholarship from Delhi University.\nM: That's right.\nW: [23]Now it seems that a handgun was found in your luggage.
