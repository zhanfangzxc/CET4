Researchers believe this may be caused by social pressure.\n    In a New York Times article, Sam Boakye—the only black student on his freshman year floor—said that “if you’re surrounded by whites, you have something to prove.”\nResearchers also observed problems resulting from pairing interracial students in residences.\n    According to two recent studies, randomly assigned roommates of different races are more likely to experience conflicts so strained that one roommate will move out.\nAn Indiana University study found that interracial roommates were three times as likely as two white roommates to no longer live together by the end of the semester.\n    Grace Kao, a professor at Penn said she was not surprised by the findings. “This may be the first time that some of these students have interacted, and lived, with someone of a different race,” she said.\n    At Penn, students are not asked to indicate race when applying for housing.\n    “One of the great things about freshman housing is that, with some exceptions, the process throws you together randomly,” said Undergraduate Assembly chairman Alec Webley. “This is the definition of integration.”\n    “I’ve experienced roommate conflicts between interracial students that have both broken down stereotypes and reinforced stereotypes,” said one Penn resident advisor(RA). The RA of two years added that while some conflicts “provided more multicultural acceptance and melding (融合),” there were also “jarring cultural confrontations.”\n    The RA said that these conflicts have also occurred among roommates of the same race.\n    Kao said she cautions against forming any generalizations based on any one of the studies, noting that more background characteristics of the students need to be studied and explained.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102423,"title":"What can we learn from some recent studies?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中的recent studies将本题定位于首段。\n解析：第一段指出，being randomly (随机地)assigned to a roommate of another race can lead to increased tolerance but also to a greater likelihood (可能性) of conflict，“随机分配不同种族的学生做室友，可能提高他们的宽容度，也有可能引发冲突。由此可见，混住会产生不同的后果，故答案为D。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Conflicts between students of different races are unavoidable."},{"option":2,"content":"Students of different races are prejudiced against each other."},{"option":3,"content":"Interracial lodging does more harm than good."},{"option":4,"content":"Interracial lodging may have diverse outcomes."}]},{"id":102424,"title":"What does Sam Boakye’s remark mean?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中的Sam Boakye's将本题处处定位到第四段。\n解析：第四段中Sam Boakye说if you’re surrounded by whites, you have something to prove，“如果你的周围都是白人学生，那么你需要证明一些东西。”也就是说，周围有白人学生的同伴能激励黑人学生去努力学习，故答案为D。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"White students tend to look down upon their black peers."},{"option":2,"content":"Black students can compete with their white peers academically."},{"option":3,"content":"Black students feel somewhat embarrassed among white peers during the freshman year."},{"option":4,"content":"Being surrounded by white peers motivates a black student to work harder to succeed."}]},{"id":102425,"title":"What does the Indiana University study show?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中的 Indiana University study将本题出处定位于第七段。\n解析：该段提到印第安纳大学的研究结果：interracial roommates were three times as likely as two white roommates to no longer live together by the end of the semester，与两个室友都是白人的情况相比，不同种族的室友到学期末不住在一起的可能性比前者大两倍。由此可推断出，混住的室友更容易散伙，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Interracial roommates are more likely to fall out."},{"option":2,"content":"Few white students like sharing a room with a black peer."},{"option":3,"content":"Roommates of different races just don’t get along."},{"option":4,"content":"Assigning students’ lodging randomly is not a good policy."}]},{"id":102426,"title":"What does Alec Webley consider to be the “definition of integration”?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中的Alec Webley及the \"definition of integration”将本题定位于第十段末句。\n解析：该句中的this指代上一句的内容，即with some exceptions, the process throws you together randomly，“除了一些特殊的情况，宿舍的安排一般是随机的”，因此Alec Webley认为“融合的定义”实际上指“随机安排学生的宿舍”，故答案为D。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Students of different races are required to share a room."},{"option":2,"content":"Interracial lodging is arranged by the school for freshmen."},{"option":3,"content":"Lodging is assigned to students of different races without exception."},{"option":4,"content":"The school randomly assigns roommates without regard to race."}]},{"id":102427,"title":"What does Grace Kao say about interracial lodging?","textExplain":"定位：题干中的Kao出现在第八段和末端，而她对于不同种族混住的看法出现在末段，故将本题出处定位在最后一段。\n解析： Grace Kao的看法是，more background characteristics of the students need to be studied and explained，“需要有更多的去研究和解释对不同种族的学生混住的情况”。也就是说，没有做进一步的研究就草率的得出任何结论是不科学的，故答案为A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is unscientific to make generalizations about it without further study."},{"option":2,"content":"Schools should be cautious when making decisions about student lodging."},{"option":3,"content":"Students’ racial background should be considered before lodging is assigned."},{"option":4,"content":"Experienced resident advisors should be assigned to handle the problems."}]}]},{"id":4421,"name":"2011.6 Passage Two","content":"    Global warming is causing more than 300,000 deaths and about $125 billion in economic losses each year, according to a report by the Global Humanitarian Forum, an organization led by Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general.\nThe report, to be released Friday, analyzed data and existing studies of health, disaster, population and economic trends. It found that human-influenced climate change was raising the global death rates from illnesses including malnutrition(营养不良) and heat-related health problems.\n    But even before its release, the report drew criticism from some experts on climate and risk, who questioned its methods and conclusions.\nAlong with the deaths, the report said that the lives of 325 million people, primarily in poor countries, were being seriously affected by climate change. It projected that the number would double by 2030.\n    Roger Pielke Jr., a political scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who studies disaster trends, said the Forum’s report was “a methodological embarrassment” because there was no way to distinguish deaths or economic losses related to human-driven global warming amid the much larger losses resulting from the growth in populations and economic development in vulnerable (易受伤害的) regions. Dr. Pielke said that “climate change is an important problem requiring our utmost attention.” But the report, he said, “will harm the cause for action on both climate change and disasters because it is so deeply flawed (有瑕疵的).”\n    However, Soren Andreasen, a social scientist at Dalberg Global Development Partners who supervised the writing of the report, defended it, saying that it was clear that the numbers were rough estimates. He said the report was aimed at world leaders, who will meet in Copenhagen in December to negotiate a new international climate treaty.\n    In a press release describing the report, Mr. Annan stressed the need for the negotiations to focus on increasing the flow of money from rich to poor regions to help reduce their vulnerability to climate hazards while still curbing the emissions of the heat-trapping gases. More than 90% of the human and economic losses from climate change are occurring in poor countries, according to the report.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102428,"title":"What is the finding of the Global Humanitarian Forum?","textExplain":"定位：题干中的 the Global Humanitarian Forum出现在首段，而第二段是对其报告结果的进一步解释，故将本题定位于前两段。\n解析：文章第二段主要介绍了报告的内容，human-influenced climate change was raising the global death rates from illnesses including malnutrition(营养不良) and heat-related health problems，“因人类影响而产生的气候变化引起了一些健康问题，导致全球死亡率上升”。选项B与原文表述一致，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Global temperatures affect the rate of economic development."},{"option":2,"content":"Rates of death from illnesses have risen due to global warming."},{"option":3,"content":"Malnutrition has caused serious health problems in poor countries."},{"option":4,"content":"Economic trends have to do with population and natural disasters."}]},{"id":102429,"title":"What do we learn about the Forum’s report from the passage?","textExplain":"定位：根据Forum’s report和上一题的位置，将本题定位在第二段之后。\n解析：第三段提到了论坛发布的报告引发的反应，the report drew criticism from some experts on climate and risk “该报道遭到了一些气候和风险专家的批评”，A与原文表述一致，changed与原文的questioned同义，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It was challenged by some climate and risk experts."},{"option":2,"content":"It aroused a lot of interest in the scientific circles."},{"option":3,"content":"It was warmly received by environmentalists."},{"option":4,"content":"It caused a big stir in developing countries."}]},{"id":102430,"title":"What does Dr. Pielke say about the Forum’s report?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中的Pielke 和the Forum's report将本题出处定位到第五段首句。\n解析：该句Pielke博士指出，论坛发布的报告是“一个方法论的尴尬”，原因在于，there was no way to distinguish deaths or economic losses related to human-driven global warming，“没有办法分辨出哪些死亡和经济损失与人为因素导致的全球变暖相关”。由此可见，Pielke 博士认为论坛发布的报告是无效的，根本无法获得准确的数据，故答案为B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Its statistics look embarrassing.
