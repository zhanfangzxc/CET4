Organized by the New York-based nonprofit Earth Pledge, the show inspired many top designers to work with sustainable fabrics for the first time. Several have since made pledges to include organic fabrics in their lines. \n    The designers who undertake green fashion still face many challenges. Scott Hahn, cofounder with Gregory of Rogan and Loomstate, which uses all-organic cotton, says high-quality sustainable materials can still be tough to find. “Most designers with existing labels are finding there aren’t comparable fabrics that can just replace what you’re doing and what your customers are used to,” he says. For example, organic cotton and non-organic cotton are virtually indistinguishable once woven into a dress. But some popular synthetics, like stretch nylon, still have few eco-friendly equivalents. \n    Those who do make the switch are finding they have more support. Last year the influential trade show Designers & Agents stopped charging its participation fee for young green entrepreneurs(企业家) who attend its two springtime shows in Los Angeles and New York and gave special recognition to designers whose collections are at least 25% sustainable. It now counts more than 50 green designers, up from fewer than a dozen two years ago . This week Wal-Mart is set to announce a major initiative aimed at helping cotton farmers go organic. It will buy transitional(过渡型的) cotton at higher prices, thus helping to expand the supply of a key sustainable material. “Mainstream is about to occur,” says Hahn.\n    Some analysts(分析师) are less sure. Among consumers, only 18% are even aware that ecofashion exists, up from 16% four years ago. Natalie Hormilla, a fashion writer, is an example of the unconverted consumer. When asked if she owned any sustainable clothes, she replied: “Not that I’m aware of.” Like most consumers, she finds little time to shop, and when she does, she’s on the hunt for “cute stuff that isn’t too expensive.” By her own admission, green just isn’t yet on her mind. But—thanks to the combined efforts of designers, retailers and suppliers—one day it will be.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102383,"title":"What is said about FutureFashion ?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中Future Fashion可定位至文中第一段第二句。\n解析：根据the show inspired many top designers to work with sustainable fabrics for the first time可知这场时装秀使了很多顶尖的设计师首次使用不破坏生态的纤维材料，故正确答案是A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It inspired many leading designers to start going green."},{"option":2,"content":"It showed that designers using organic fabrics would go far."},{"option":3,"content":"It served as an example of how fashion shows should be organized."},{"option":4,"content":"It convinced the public that fashionable clothes should be made durable."}]},{"id":102384,"title":"According to Scott Hahn, one big challenge to designers who will go organic is that______.","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中Scott Hahn与challenge可定位至文中第二段。\n解析：根据The designers who undertake green fashion still face many challenges可知答案就在下面，再根据But some popular synthetics, like stretch nylon, still have few eco-friendly equivalents可知设计师使用有机材料面临的挑战是取代有机材料的人工合成材料很少，故正确答案是D。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"much more time is needed to finish a dress using sustainable materials"},{"option":2,"content":"they have to create new brands for clothes made of organic materials"},{"option":3,"content":"customers have difficulty telling organic from non-organic materials"},{"option":4,"content":"quality organic replacements for synthetics are not readily available"}]},{"id":102385,"title":"We learn from Paragraph 3 that designers who undertake green fashion__________.","textExplain":"定位：根据题干可定位至文中第三段。\n解析：根据Those who do make the switch are finding they have more support可知做出这种转变的（采用有机材料）的设计师得到了更多人的支持，故正确答案为D。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"can attend various trade shows free"},{"option":2,"content":"are readily recognized by the fashion world"},{"option":3,"content":"can buy organic cotton at favorable prices"},{"option":4,"content":"are gaining more and more support"}]},{"id":102386,"title":"What is Natalie Hormilla’s attitude toward ecofashion?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中Natalie Hormilla可定位至文中最后一段。\n解析：根据Not that I’m aware of及green just isn’t yet on her mind可知Natalie Hormilla不关心这件事，故正确答案是A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"She doesn’t seem to care about it."},{"option":2,"content":"She doesn’t think it is sustainable."},{"option":3,"content":"She is doubtful of its practical value."},{"option":4,"content":"She is very much opposed to the idea."}]},{"id":102387,"title":"What does the author think of green fashion?","textExplain":"定位：本题考查作者对绿色时尚的态度，可定位至第一段或者最后一段。\n解析：根据最后一段one day it will be，可知在未来总有一天人们会在意生态时尚的，与B选项意思吻合，故正确答案是B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Green products will soon go mainstream."},{"option":2,"content":"It has a very promising future."},{"option":3,"content":"Consumers have the final say."},{"option":4,"content":"It will appeal more to young people."}]}]},{"id":4381,"name":"2009.6 Passage Two","content":"    Scientists have devised a way to determine roughly where a person has lived using a strand(缕) of hair, a technique that could help track the movements of criminal suspects or unidentified murder victims. \n    The method relies on measuring how chemical variations in drinking water show up in people’s hair. \n    “You’re what you eat and drink, and that’s recorded in your hair, ” said Tilure Cerling, a geologist at the University of Utah. \n    While U.S. diet is relatively identical, water supplies vary. The differences result from weather patterns. The chemical composition of rainfall changes slightly as rain clouds move.\n    Most hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water are stable, but traces of both elements are also present as heavier isotopes (同位素) . The heaviest rain falls first. As a result, storms that form over the Pacific deliver heavier water to California than to Utah.\n    Similar patterns exist throughout the U.S. By measuring the proportion of heavier hydrogen and oxygen isotopes along a strand of hair, scientists can construct a geographic timeline. Each inch of hair corresponds to about two months. \n    Cerling’s team collected tap water samples from 600 cities and constructed a map of the regional differences. They checked the accuracy of the map by testing 200 hair samples collected from 65 barber shops.\n    They were able to accurately place the hair samples in broad regions roughly corresponding to the movement of rain systems .\n    “It’s not good for pinpointing(精确定位),” Cerling said. “it’s good for eliminating many possibilities .”\nTodd Park, a local detective, said the method has helped him learn more about an unidentified woman whose skeleton was found near Great Salt Lake.\nThe woman was 5 feet tall. Police recovered 26 bones, a T-shirt and several strands of hair.\nWhen Park heard about the research, he gave the hair samples to the researchers. Chemical testing showed that over the two years before her death, she moved about every two months.\nShe stayed in the Northwest, although the test could not be more specific than somewhere between eastern Oregon and western Wyoming.\n“It’s still a substantial area,” Park said. “But it narrows it way down for me.”","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102388,"title":"What is the scientists’ new discovery?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中scientists’ new discovery可定位至文中第一段。\n解析：根据Scientists have devised a way to determine roughly where a person has lived using a strand (缕) of hair可知科学家的新发现是使用一缕头发大概能判断一个人的居住地方，故正确答案是B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"One’s hair growth has to do with the amount of water they drink."},{"option":2,"content":"A person’s hair may reveal where they have lived."},{"option":3,"content":"Hair analysis accurately identifies criminal suspects.
