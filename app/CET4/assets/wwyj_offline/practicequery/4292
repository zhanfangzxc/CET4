When we are busy, people get angry and sharp, but that’s normal.\nW: How did you learn the profession?\nM: Well, I did a two-year course at college.

I thought it was quite interesting, but I don’t quite understand the column entitled change. Can you explain what it means?\nW: Well, I think it means the change from the year before. I am not a mathematician, but I assume the rise from 70p to 90p is a rise of 25 percent.\nM: Oh, yes, I see. And the inflation rate is there for comparison.\nW: Yes. [24]Why do you think the rise in pocket money is often higher than inflation?\nM: I am sorry, I’ve no idea. Perhaps parents in Britain are too generous.\nW: Perhaps they are. But it looks as if children were a lot better off in 2001 than they were in 2002. That’s strange, isn’t it? And they seem to have been better off in 2003 than they are now. I wonder why that is.\nM: Yes, I don’t understand that at all.\nW: Anyway, if you had children, how much pocket money would you give them?\nM: I don’t know. I think I’ll probably give them 2 pounds a week.\nW: Would you?
