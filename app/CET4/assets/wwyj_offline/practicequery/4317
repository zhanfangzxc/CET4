Tonight, we have Mr. Steven Kayne, who has just taken over and established a bicycle shop. Tell us, Mr. Kayne, what made you want to run your own store?\nM: Well, I always loved racing bikes and fixing them. [20]When I was working full-time as a salesman for a big company, I seldom had time to enjoy my hobby. I knew then that as soon as I had enough money to get my own business going, I’ll do it. I had my heart set on it and I didn’t let anything stand in my way. [21]When I went down to the bank and got a business loan, I knew I’d love being my own boss. Now my time is my own. I open the store when I want and leave when I want.\nW:You mean you don’t keep regular hours?\nM: Well, the sign on my store says the hours are ten to six, but if business is slower than usual, I can just lock up and take off early.\nW: Have you hired any employees to work with you yet?\nM:[22]Yeah, a couple of friends of mine who love biking as much as I do. They help me out a few days a week. It’s great because we play cards or just sit around and talk when there are no customers. \nW: Thank you, Mr. Kayne. We wish you success in your new business.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/201206/2012-6-C1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102222,"title":"What is the woman doing?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n女士话中Good evening and welcome to this week's Business World“大家晚上好，欢迎收看本周的商业世界”，与D选项Hosting an evening TV program“主持晚间电视节目”构成同义替换。女士正在主持《商业世界》节目，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Having her bicycle repaired."},{"option":2,"content":"Conducting a market survey."},{"option":3,"content":"Lecturing on business management."},{"option":4,"content":"Hosting an evening TV program."}]},{"id":102223,"title":"What did Mr. Kayne do before he took over the bicycle shop?

Could you tell us something about that? \nW: Yes, of course. In fact, they are less significant. [23]But steel-related manufacturing  still accounts for 44% of industrial activity, so it’s  still very important. In fact, 80% of Spain’s machine tools are from the Basque Country. As for paper processing, there’s still a little. But it’s no longer what it once was in the region. So, is that clear?\nM: Yes, thanks.\nW: Now, to get back to what I was saying, there’s a lot of unemployment as well as geographical problems in the region.\nM: Sorry, Victoria. What do you mean by geographical problems?\nW: Well, what I mean is the area is very hilly, mountainous in parts, so there used to be transport problems, now though, there are new train links and better roads. [24] But it may be that some smaller towns inland remain not very well connected, is that OK? Does that make sense? [25]When we talk about specific location suggestions for the factory, we’ll see this in more detail, so we’ll come back to this question, OK?\nM: OK, right.\nW: So I was about to say something about the work force in the region and the level of training and education. In general, it’s very good and improving.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/201206/2012-6-C2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102226,"title":"What does the woman say about the steel-related manufacturing in the region?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词still后面still accounts for 44% of industrial activity“仍占这一地区经济产业的44%”和still very important“依然很重要”，与B选项remains a major part“仍是重要组成部分”构成同义替换。女士说钢铁制造行业仍是该地区工业活动的重要组成部分，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It has gradually given way to service industry."},{"option":2,"content":"It remains a major part of industrial activity."},{"option":3,"content":"It accounts for 80 percent of the region's GDP."},{"option":4,"content":"It has a history as long as paper processing."}]},{"id":102227,"title":"What problems hinder the region’s development?
