I need some information about some of the towns near here.\nW: What would you like to know?\nM: Well, first, I’d like directions to go to Norwalk. I believe there is an interesting museum there. It isn’t far, is it?\nW: No, not at all. Norwalk is about eighteen miles east of here on Route 7. And you’re right. It’s a wonderful little museum.\nM: Oh, good. Now what about Amitsville? I have some friends. I’d like to visit there and I also want to get to Newton. They are near each other, aren’t they?\nW: Hmm... well, they are actually in opposite directions. Amitsville is northeast. It’s about thirty-five miles northeast of here.\nM: Huh-uh, thirty-five miles northeast. And how about Newton?\nW: Well, Newton is in the other direction. It’s southwest. So it isn’t really very close to Amitsville at all and it’s a long drive. It’s about fifty-five miles southwest from here and the road is not at all straight.\nM: Fifty-five miles southwest! Well, maybe I won’t go there this time.\nW: I’d recommend visiting Westfield or Great Town. They are both very close. Westfield is just seven miles west of here and Great Town is about five miles south. They are really pretty little towns with lots of old houses and beautiful tree-lined streets.\nM: I see. Seven miles west to Westfield and five miles south to Great Town. Good! Well, I think that’s all the information I’ll need for a while. Thank you. You’ve been very helpful.\nW: You’re welcome, sir. I hope you enjoy your stay.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/20131201/2013-12(1)-C1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":103188,"title":"What does the man know about Norwalk?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词first之后an interesting museum，“一座有意思的博物馆”，与B选项构成视听一致。对话开头男士问女士去Norwalk怎么走，并提到那里有一座很有意思的博物馆，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is located on Route 18."},{"option":2,"content":"It has an interesting museum."},{"option":3,"content":"It is a beautiful little town."},{"option":4,"content":"It lies seven miles east of Newton."}]},{"id":103189,"title":"What does the woman say about Amitsville and Newton?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词actually之后they are actually in opposite directions，“它们事实上是在相反的方向”，与A选项构成视听一致。女士说Amitsville和Newton在相反的方向，一个在东北方向，一个在西南方向，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They are in opposite directions."},{"option":2,"content":"They are fifty-five miles apart."},{"option":3,"content":"They are quite close to each other."},{"option":4,"content":"They are a long drive from Norwalk."}]},{"id":103190,"title":"What do we learn about Westfield and Great Town?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n女士话中lots of old houses，“很多古建筑”，与C选项构成视听一致。女士建议男士去Westfield或Great Town这两个比较近的地方，并简要介绍了它们的情况：它们都是美丽的小城，有许多古建筑，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They are connected by Route 7."},{"option":2,"content":"They are crowded with tourists."},{"option":3,"content":"They have lots of old houses."},{"option":4,"content":"They have many rare plants."}]}]},{"id":5156,"name":"2013.12 (Conversation Two 卷一)","content":"M: Err...
