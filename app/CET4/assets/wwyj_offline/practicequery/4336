[26]Six 4-H girls worked to clean the 72 foot curbside that was covered with weeds, rocks and trash. [27]Each member volunteered to clean up and to dig and plant five flats of flowers. They also took turns in watering, weeding and maintaining the plant. Participation in this project helped the girls developed a new attitude towards their parents of their own homes; [28]they've learned how to work with tools, and improve their work habits. One mother said that before her daughter was involved in this project, she would not even pull a weed. The experience on Main Street stimulated self-improvement, and encouraged members to take pride in their home grounds and the total community. City officials cooperated with the 4-H members in planting trees, building cooking facilities, picnic tables, swings and public restrooms. The 4-H girls planted trees and took care of them during the early stages of growth. The total park project needed more plantings in the following years. Members of the 4-H club agreed to follow the project through to completion, [29] because they receive satisfaction from the results of constructive work. The project is a growing one and has spread from the park to the school and the shopping center. Trees and flowers have all been planted in the shopping center, making the atmosphere pleasant.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/20130601/2013-6(1)-P1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102353,"title":"What do we learn about Main Street in Farmington?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n文章开头处was covered with weeds, rocks and trash“覆盖着野草、石块和垃圾”，与D选项dirty and disorderly“又脏又乱”构成同义替换。缅因街过去是又脏又乱的，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is lined with tall trees."},{"option":2,"content":"It was widened recently."},{"option":3,"content":"It has high buildings on both sides."},{"option":4,"content":"It used to be dirty and disorderly."}]},{"id":102354,"title":"What do the 4-H club members do about the curbside?

Over 50% of the 12 to 18 years old interviewed said they enjoy reading a lot. [30]79% find it stimulating and interesting. And 87% think it is relaxing. About 68% of those surveyed disagreed with the opinion that reading is boring or old-fashioned.\n    Over half teenagers interviewed said they read more than ten books a year. The results also showed that middle school students read more books than high schoolers. [31]Over 66% of teens like to read fiction, such as novels and stories. Only 26% were interested in non-fiction, such as history books. 64% of students listed reading stories about people my own age. That's a favorite topic. Mysteries and detective stories came second on the list at 53%. Just under 50% said they were interested in reading about their own culture and tradition. Of the teenagers who participated in the survey, 49% said that libraries are where they get most of their books. However, many complain that their school libraries do not have enough up-to-date interesting books and magazines. Even though many teenagers in the U.S. enjoy reading, they still have other interests. [32]When asked which activity would be the most difficult to give up for a week, 48% said listening to music.

Today’s presentation will show how we see the [33] development of the motor car in the short to medium term, and that is why we have invited all of you here today. Let’s start with power. It’s clear that petrol-driven engines have no future. Already there are many alternative fuel vehicles on the market, powered by anything from solar power to natural gas. Some independent thinkers have even produced cars that run on vegetable oil. But as we all know, of all these alternative fuel vehicles, the most practical are electric vehicles. Sure, in the past, electric vehicles have their problems, [34]namely, a limited driving range, and very few recharging points, which limited their use. [35]Now, however, recent developments in electric vehicle technology mean they can match conventional petrol engines in terms of performance and safety. Let’s not forget that electric vehicles are cleaner. Plus, importantly, the power source is rechargeable, so this does not involve using any valuable resources. Moving on to communications, very soon, cars will be linked to GPS satellites, so they’ll do all the driving for you. What controls the remain for the users will be audio-based. So, for example, you’ll just have to say “a bit warmer”, and the air conditioning will adjust automatically. You’ll also be able to receive email, music and movies, all via an internet link. So just type in the destination you want, sit back, sleep, watch your movie, whatever.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/20130601/2013-6(1)-P3.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102360,"title":"What is the presentation mainly about?
