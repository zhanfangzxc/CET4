{"errorCode":0,"progress":0.0,"practiceJsons":[{"id":4286,"name":"2010.12 Passage One","content":"    One of the greatest heartbreaks for firefighters occurs when they fail to rescue a child from a burning building because the child, frightened by smoke and noise, hides under a bed or in a closet and is later found dead. [26]Saddest of all is when children catch a glimpse of the masked firefighter but hide because they think they have seen a monster. [27]To prevent such tragedies, firefighter Eric Velez gives talks to children in his community, explaining that they should never hide during a fire.  He displays firefighters’ equipment, including the oxygen mask, which he encourages his listeners to play with and put on. “If you see us,” Velez tells them, “don’t hide! We are not monsters. We have come to rescue you.” Velez gives his presentations in English and Spanish. Growing up in San Francisco, he learnt Spanish from his immigrant parents. Velez and other firefighters throughout North America, who give similar presentations, will never know how many lives they save through their talks. [29] But it’s a fact that informative speaking saves lives. [28] For example, several months after listening to an informative speech, Pete Gentry in North Carolina rescued his brother who was choking on food, by using the method taught by student speaker, Julie Paris. In addition to saving lives, informative speakers help people learn new skills, solve problems and acquire fascinating facts about the exciting world in which they live.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/201012/2010-12-P1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102294,"title":"Why do some children trapped in a burning building hide from masked firefighters?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词because后面they think they have seen a monster“他们认为自己看到的是怪兽”，与D选项They mistake the firefighters for monsters“他们误把消防队员当成怪兽”构成同义替换。孩子们看到带着面具的消防队员误以为是怪兽，所以藏了起来，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They cannot see the firefighters because of the smoke."},{"option":2,"content":"They cannot hear the firefighters for the noise."},{"option":3,"content":"They do not realize the danger they are in."},{"option":4,"content":"They mistake the firefighters for monsters."}]},{"id":102295,"title":"What does the passage tell us about firefighter Eric Velez?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n原文中gives talks to children in his community, explaining that they should never hide during a fire“给他的社区里的孩子讲火灾时哪里不能躲藏”，与A选项teaches children what to do during a fire“教孩子在火灾中应该做什么”构成同义替换，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He often teaches children what to do during a fire."},{"option":2,"content":"He teaches Spanish in a San Francisco community."},{"option":3,"content":"He provides oxygen masks to children free of charge."},{"option":4,"content":"He travels all over America to help put out fires."}]},{"id":102296,"title":"What do we learn about Pete Gentry?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词For example后面rescued his brother who was choking on food“挽救了他吃东西噎着的弟弟”，与D选项saved the life of his brother choking on food构成同义替换，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He gives informative talks to young children."},{"option":2,"content":"He is very good at public speaking."},{"option":3,"content":"He rescued a student from a big fire."},{"option":4,"content":"He saved the life of his brother choking on food."}]},{"id":102297,"title":"What message is the speaker trying to convey?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词But和it’s … that后面informative speaking saves lives“告知性演讲够挽救生命”，与D选项Informative speeches can save lives构成视听一致。Speaker说掌握信息能够挽救生命，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Kids should learn not to be afraid of monsters."},{"option":2,"content":"Firefighters play an important role in America."},{"option":3,"content":"Carelessness can result in tragedies."},{"option":4,"content":"Informative speeches can save lives."}]}]},{"id":4289,"name":"2010.12 Passage Two","content":"    [30]Some people want to make and save a lot of money  in order to  retire early. I see people pursuing higher paying and increasingly demanding careers to accomplish this goal. They make many personal sacrifices in exchange for income today. The problem is that tomorrow might not come. Even if it all goes according to plan, will you know how to be happy when you are not working if you spend your entire life making money? More importantly, who will be around for you to share your leisure time with? At the other extreme are people who live only for today. Why bother saving when I might not be here tomorrow, they argue. The danger of this approach is that tomorrow may come after all. And most people don't want to spend all their tomorrows working for a living. [31]The earlier neglect of saving, however, makes it difficult not to work when you are older. [32]You may be surprised to hear me say that if you must pick an extreme, I think it's better to pick the spend-all approach. As long as you don't mind continuing to work, assuming your health allows, you should be OK. At least, you are making use of your money, and hopefully deriving value and pleasure from it. Postponing doing what you love and being with people you love until retirement can be a mistake. It may never come. Retirement can be a great time for some people. For others, it is a time of boredom, loneliness and poor health.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/201012/2010-12-P2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102298,"title":"Why do some people pursue higher paying but demanding careers?

How fair will that be? Well, it happens every day to high-schoolers. [33]Just because some students have stolen things in shops, all of us are treated like thieves. Even though I’d never steal, store employees looked at me like I’m some kind of hardened criminal. For example, during one lunch period, my friend Denny and I went to the Graben Gore Restaurant to have a hotdog. We arrived to find a line of students waiting outside. A new sign in the window told the story. [34]“No more than two students at a time”. After 15 minutes, we finally got in. But the store manager laid the evil eye on us. I asked him about the new sign, and he said, “You kids are stealing too much stuff.” You kids? Too much stuff? We were not only assumed to be thieves, but brilliant, greedy thieves. The most annoying thing, though, is the way employees watched my friends and me. It’s horrible. Once, at a drug store, I was looking around and found a guy standing on a large box, stocking the shelves. [35]He was watching my hands, more than he was watching his own. I showed him that my hands were empty. He got down off his box and rushed off, as if he was going to get the store manager.
