They record where you’re going, how fast you're traveling and whether everything on your airplane is functioning normally. Their ability to withstand almost any disaster makes them seem like something out of a comic book. They're known as the black box.\n    When planes fall from the sky, as a Yemeni airliner did on its way to Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean June 30, 2009, the black box is the best bet for identifying what went wrong. So when a French submarine (潜水艇) detected the device's homing signal five days later, the discovery marked a huge step toward determining the cause of a tragedy in which 152 passengers were killed.\n    In 1958, Australian scientist David Warren developed a flight-memory recorder that would track basic information like altitude and direction. That was the first model for a black box, which became a requirement on all U.S. commercial flights by 1960. Early models often failed to withstand crashes, however, so in 1965 the device was completely redesigned and moved to the rear of the plane–the area least subject to impact–from its original position in the landing wells (起落架舱). That same year, the Federal Aviation Authority required that the boxes, which were never actually black, be painted orange or yellow to aid visibility.\n    Modern airplanes have two black boxes: a voice recorder, which tracks pilots' conversations, and a flight-data recorder, which monitors fuel levels, engine noises and other operating functions that help investigators reconstruct the aircraft's final moments. Placed in an insulated (隔绝的) case and surrounded by a quarter-inch-thick panels of stainless steel, the boxes can withstand massive force and temperatures up to 2,000℉. When submerged, they're also able to emit signals from depths of 20,000 ft. Experts believe the boxes from Air France Flight 447, which crashed near Brazil on June 1,2009, are in water nearly that deep, but statistics say they're still likely to turn up. In the approximately 20 deep-sea crashes over the past 30 years, only one plane's black boxes were never recovered.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102888,"title":"What does the author say about the black box?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中black box定位到第一段。\n解析：根据but they're with you every time you fly，可知只要你乘坐飞机，它们（黑匣子）就会伴随你，由此可知它是飞机上必不可少的设备，即D选项所说的an indispensable device on an airplane，故正确答案是D。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It ensures the normal functioning of an airplane."},{"option":2,"content":"The idea for its design comes from a comic book."},{"option":3,"content":"Its ability to ward off disasters is incredible."},{"option":4,"content":"It is an indispensable device on an airplane."}]},{"id":102889,"title":"What information could be found from the black box on the Yemeni airliner?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中Yemeni airliner可定位到第二段第一句话。\n解析：根据When planes fall from the sky ... the black box is the best bet for identifying what went wrong可知Yemeni airliner事故时检测黑匣子是鉴定事故原因的最佳办法，由此可见黑匣子能够提供帮助分析事故原因的信息，故正确答案是A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Data for analyzing the cause of the crash."},{"option":2,"content":"The total number of passengers on board."},{"option":3,"content":"The scene of the crash and extent of the damage."},{"option":4,"content":"Homing signals sent by the pilot before the crash."}]},{"id":102890,"title":"Why was the black box redesigned in 1965?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中redesigned和in 1965可定位到第三段第三句话。\n解析：根据Early models often failed to withstand crashes，早期的黑匣子经常经受不住碰撞，所以在1965年重新设计了黑匣子，故正确答案是C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"New materials became available by that time."},{"option":2,"content":"Too much space was needed for its installation."},{"option":3,"content":"The early models often got damaged in the crash."},{"option":4,"content":"The early models didn't provide the needed data."}]},{"id":102891,"title":"Why did the Federal Aviation Authority require the black boxes be painted orange or yellow?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中Federal Aviation Authority 和 be painted orange or yellow可定位到第三段最后一句话。\n解析：根据The same year, the Federal Aviation Authority required that the boxes, which were never actually black, be painted orange or yellow to aid visibility，可知美国联邦航空局要求把黑匣子漆成橙色或黄色以助于被发现，故正确答案是C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"To distinguish them from the color of the plane."},{"option":2,"content":"To caution people to handle them with care."},{"option":3,"content":"To make them easily identifiable."},{"option":4,"content":"To conform to international standards."}]},{"id":102892,"title":"What do we know about the black boxes from Air France Flight 447?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中Air France Flight 447定位到第四段第四句话。\n解析：根据but statistics say they're still likely to turn up，原文说Air France Flight 447的黑匣子就落到了深海中，但数据显示它们仍有可能出现，故正确答案是A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"There is still a good chance of their being recovered."},{"option":2,"content":"There is an urgent need for them to be restructured."},{"option":3,"content":"They have stopped sending homing signals."},{"option":4,"content":"They were destroyed somewhere near Brazil."}]}]},{"id":4885,"name":"2010.6 Passage Two","content":"    The $11 billion self-help industry is built on the idea that you should turn negative thoughts like \"I never do anything right\" into positive ones like \"I can succeed.\" But was positive thinking advocate Norman Vincent Peale right? Is there power in positive thinking?\n    Researchers in Canada just published a study in the journal Psychological Science that says trying to get people to think more positively can actually have the opposite effect: it can simply highlight how unhappy they are.\n    The study's authors, Joanne Wood and John Lee of the University of Waterloo and Elaine Perunovic of the University of New Brunswick, begin by citing older research showing that when people get feedback which they believe is overly positive, they actually feel worse, not better. If you tell your dim friend that he has the potential of an Einstein, you're just underlining his faults. In one 1990s experiment, a team including psychologist Joel Cooper of Princeton asked participants to write essays opposing funding for the disabled. When the essayists were late praised for their sympathy, they felt even worse about what they had written.\n    In this experiment, Wood, Lee and Perunovic measured 68 students' self-esteem. The participants were then asked to write down their thoughts and feelings for four minutes. Every 15 seconds, one group of students heard a bell. When it rang, they were supposed to tell themselves, \"I am lovable.\"\n    Those with low self-esteem didn't feel better after the forced self-affirmation. In fact, their moods turned significantly darker than those of members of the control group, who weren't urged to think positive thoughts.\n    The paper provides support for newer forms of psychotherapy (心理治疗) that urge people to accept their negative thoughts and feelings rather than fight them. In the fighting, we not only often fail but can make things worse. Meditation (静思) techniques, in contrast, can teach people to put their shortcomings into a larger, more realistic perspective.

While it may be common for university researchers to try their luck in the commercial world, there is very little traffic in the opposite direction. Pay has always been the biggest deterrent, as people with families often feel they cannot afford the drop in salary when moving to a university job. For some industrial scientists, however, the attractions of academia (学术界) outweigh any financial considerations.\n    Helen Lee took a 70% cut in salary when she moved from a senior post in Abbott Laboratories to a medical department at the University of Cambridge. Her main reason for returning to academia mid-career was to take advantage of the greater freedom to choose research questions. Some areas of inquiry have few prospects of a commercial return, and Lee’s is one of them.\n    The impact of a salary cut is probably less severe for a scientist in the early stages of a career. Guy Grant, now a research associate at the Unilever Centre for Molecular Informatics at the University of Cambridge, spent two years working for a pharmaceutical (制药的) company before returning to university as a post-doctoral researcher. He took a 30% salary cut but felt it worthwhile for the greater intellectual opportunities.\n    Higher up the ladder, where a pay cut is usually more significant, the demand for scientists with a wealth of experience in industry is forcing universities to make the transition (转换) to academia more attractive, according to Lee. Industrial scientists tend to receive training that academics do not, such as how to build a multidisciplinary team, manage budgets and negotiate contracts. They are also well placed to bring something extra to the teaching side of an academic role that will help students get a job when they graduate, says Lee, perhaps experience in manufacturing practice or product development, “Only a small number of undergraduates will continue in an academic career. So someone leaving university who already has the skills needed to work in an industrial lab has far more potential in the job market than someone who has spent all their time on a narrow research project.”","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102898,"title":"By “a one-way street” (Line 1, Para. 1), the author means ________.","textExplain":"定位：据题干中的a one-way street将本题定位于首段首句。\n解析：a one-way street意思为“单行道”。第二句While it may be common for university researchers to try their luck in the commercial world, there is very little traffic in the opposite direction，“尽管大学研究人员去工商业界碰运气很普遍，但是反面的情况却很少”，也就是说产业科学家转行从事科研不常见，故此题答案选B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"university researchers know little about the commercial world"},{"option":2,"content":"few industrial scientists would quit to work in a university"},{"option":3,"content":"few university professors are willing to do industrial research"},{"option":4,"content":"there is little exchange between industry and academia"}]},{"id":102899,"title":"The word “deterrent” (Line 3, Para. 1) most probably refers to something that ________.","textExplain":"定位：据题干中的deterrent将本题定位于第一段第三句。\n解析：其前半句指出，收入一直以来都是最大的deterrent，而后半句解释其原因as people with families often feel they cannot afford the drop in salary when moving to a university job，有家室的人都无法接受工资上的落差。由此可推断deterrent困难、障碍的意思，即“组织某人采取行动的东西”，故答案选C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"brings someone a financial burden"},{"option":2,"content":"helps to move the traffic "},{"option":3,"content":"keeps someone from taking action"},{"option":4,"content":"attracts people’s attention"}]},{"id":102900,"title":"What was Helen Lee’s major consideration when she changed her job in the middle of her career?","textExplain":"定位：据题干中的Helen lee和middle f her career将本题定位于第二段第二句。\n解析： Helen lee在事业发展中期换工作的原因是take advantage of the greater freedom to choose research questions，“利用那里更大的自由权来选择研究专题”。也就是说，她换工作主要是考虑到个人的研究兴趣，故选A。 ","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Her research interests."},{"option":2,"content":"Flexible work hours."},{"option":3,"content":"Prospects of academic accomplishments."},{"option":4,"content":"Her preference for the lifestyle on campus."}]},{"id":102901,"title":"Guy Grant chose to work as a researcher at Cambridge in order to ________.","textExplain":"定位：据题干中Guy Grant和a researcher at Cambridge将本题定位于第三段第二、三句。\n解析：第三段第二句提到，Guy Grant在制药公司干了两年之后到剑桥大学当助理研究员，第三句接着提到他的收入减少了30%，但是，他感觉为了有更好的机会发展自己的才智，这些损失是值得的。原句中的intellectual opportunities直接出现于C中，而且exploit和for，better和greater在意义上一一对应，由此确定答案选C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"do financially more rewarding work"},{"option":2,"content":"raise his status in the academic world"},{"option":3,"content":"exploit better intellectual opportunities"},{"option":4,"content":"enrich his experience in medical research"}]},{"id":102902,"title":"What contribution can industrial scientists make when they come to teach in a university?","textExplain":"定位：据题干中的industrial scientists和 teach将本题定位于最后一段第三句。\n解析：该句中，They are also well placed to bring something extra to the teaching side of an academic role that will help students get a job when they graduate，意思是产业科学家们到大学教学能够给学生们带来一些产业实验室里的工作技能，这些技能可以增强学生在就业市场上的竞争力，故答案选A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Increase its graduates’ competitiveness in the job market."},{"option":2,"content":"Help it to obtain financial support from industry."},{"option":3,"content":"Gear its research towards practical applications."},{"option":4,"content":"Develop its students’ potential in research."}]}]},{"id":4895,"name":"2010.12 Passage Passage Two","content":"    Being sociable looks like a good way to add years to your life. Relationships with family, friends, neighbours, even pets, will all do the trick, but the biggest longevity (长寿) boost seems to come from marriage or an equivalent relationship. The effect was first noted in 1858 by William Farr, who wrote that widows and widowers (鳏夫) were at a much higher risk of dying than their married peers. Studies since then suggest that marriage could add as much as seven years to a man’s life and two to a woman’s. The effect holds for all causes of death, whether illness, accident or self-harm.\n    Even if the odds are stacked against you, marriage can more than compensate. Linda Waite of the University of Chicago has found that a married older man with heart disease can expect to live nearly four years longer than an unmarried man with a healthy heart. Likewise, a married man who smokes more than a pack a day is likely to live as long as a divorced man who doesn’t smoke. There’s a flip side, however, as partners are more likely to become ill or die in the couple of years following their spouse’s death, and caring for a spouse with mental disorder can leave you with some of the same severe problems. Even so, the odds favour marriage. In a 30-year study of more than 10,000 people, Nicholas Christakis of Harvard Medical School describes how all kinds of social networks have similar effects.\n    So how does it work? The effects are complex, affected by socio-economic factors, health-service provision, emotional support and other more physiological (生理的) mechanisms. For example, social contact can boost development of the brain and immune system, leading to better health and less chance of depression later in life. People in supportive relationships may handle stress better. Then there are the psychological benefits of a supportive partner.\n    A life partner, children and good friends are all recommended if you aim to live to 100. The ultimate social network is still being mapped out, but as Christakis says: “People are interconnected, so their health is interconnected.”","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102903,"title":"William Farr’s study and other studies show that _________.","textExplain":"定位：据题干中的William Farr和studies将本题定位于首段三句。\n解析：第三句是对第二句的详细解释，第二句中but the biggest longevity boost seems to come from marriage or an equivalent relationship，“最能促进长寿的是婚姻或类似伴侣关系”，所以选择B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"social life provides an effective cure for illness"},{"option":2,"content":"marriage contributes a great deal to longevity"},{"option":3,"content":"women benefit more than men from marriage"},{"option":4,"content":"being sociable helps improve one’s quality of life"}]},{"id":102904,"title":"Linda Waite’s studies support the idea that _________.","textExplain":"定位：据题干中的Linda Waite将本题定位于第二段第二句。\n解析：该句提到Linda Waite的研究发现，a married older man with heart disease can expect to live nearly four years longer than an unmarried man with a healthy heart，“一位患有心脏病的已婚老人会比同样会有此病的未婚老人多活将近四年”。该段第一句话说，即使一切情况都对你不利，婚姻也能够起到很大的弥补作用，不难得出答案为C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"the married are happier than the unmarried"},{"option":2,"content":"older men should quit smoking to stay healthy"},{"option":3,"content":"marriage can help make up for ill health"},{"option":4,"content":"unmarried people are likely to suffer in later life"}]},{"id":102905,"title":"It can be inferred from the context that the “flip side” (Line 5, Para. 2) refers to _________.","textExplain":"定位：据题干中的flip side将本题定位于第二段第四句。\n解析：该句中partners are more likely to become ill or die in the couple of years following their spouse’s death, and caring for a spouse with mental disorder can leave you with some of the same severe problems，“在配偶过世的几年里，另一半更有可能病倒或死亡，照顾患有心理障碍的配偶也会导致你患有同样严重的疾病”，可知婚姻也有不利的地方，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"the consequence of a broken marriage"},{"option":2,"content":"the emotional problems arising from marriage"},{"option":3,"content":"the responsibility of taking care of one’s family"},{"option":4,"content":"the disadvantages of being married"}]},{"id":102906,"title":"What does the author say about social networks?","textExplain":"定位：据题干中的social networks将本题定位于第二段末句。\n解析：该句提到social networks have similar effects，“社交网络与婚姻关系有相似的效果”，故答案选D。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They help develop people’s community spirit."},{"option":2,"content":"They provide timely support for those in need."},{"option":3,"content":"They help relieve people of their life’s burdens."},{"option":4,"content":"They have effects similar to those of a marriage."}]},{"id":102907,"title":"What can be inferred from the last paragraph?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干可定位到最后一段。\n解析：该段第一句提到，如果你希望长命百岁，拥有终生伴侣、孩子、好朋友都是值得推荐的。其中的“终身伴侣、子女和好朋友” 都是社交网络的组成部分，而A中的To stay healthy也是对live to 100的同义转述，故确定答案为A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"To stay healthy, one should have a proper social network."},{"option":2,"content":"Getting a divorce means risking a reduced life span."},{"option":3,"content":"We should share our social networks with each other."},{"option":4,"content":"It’s important that we develop a social network when young."}]}]},{"id":4900,"name":"2011.6 Passage One","content":"    Several recent studies have found that being randomly (随机地)assigned to a roommate of another race can lead to increased tolerance but also to a greater likelihood (可能性) of conflict. \n    Recent reports found that lodging with a student of a different race may decrease prejudice and compel students to engage in more ethnically diverse friendships.\nAn Ohio State University study also found that black students living with a white roommate saw higher academic success throughout their college careers.

It found that human-influenced climate change was raising the global death rates from illnesses including malnutrition(营养不良) and heat-related health problems.\nBut even before its release, the report drew criticism from some experts on climate and risk, who questioned its methods and conclusions.\nAlong with the deaths, the report said that the lives of 325 million people, primarily in poor countries, were being seriously affected by climate change. It projected that the number would double by 2030.\nRoger Pielke Jr., a political scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who studies disaster trends, said the Forum’s report was “a methodological embarrassment” because there was no way to distinguish deaths or economic losses related to human-driven global warming amid the much larger losses resulting from the growth in populations and economic development in vulnerable (易受伤害的) regions. Dr. Pielke said that “climate change is an important problem requiring our utmost attention.” But the report, he said, “will harm the cause for action on both climate change and disasters because it is so deeply flawed (有瑕疵的).”\nHowever, Soren Andreasen, a social scientist at Dalberg Global Development Partners who supervised the writing of the report, defended it, saying that it was clear that the numbers were rough estimates. He said the report was aimed at world leaders, who will meet in Copenhagen in December to negotiate a new international climate treaty.\nIn a press release describing the report, Mr. Annan stressed the need for the negotiations to focus on increasing the flow of money from rich to poor regions to help reduce their vulnerability to climate hazards while still curbing the emissions of the heat-trapping gases. More than 90% of the human and economic losses from climate change are occurring in poor countries, according to the report.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102913,"title":"What is the finding of the Global Humanitarian Forum?","textExplain":"定位：题干中的 the Global Humanitarian Forum出现在首段，而第二段是对其报告结果的进一步解释，故将本题定位于前两段。\n解析：文章第二段主要介绍了报告的内容，human-influenced climate change was raising the global death rates from illnesses including malnutrition(营养不良) and heat-related health problems，“因人类影响而产生的气候变化引起了一些健康问题，导致全球死亡率上升”。选项B与原文表述一致，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Global temperatures affect the rate of economic development."},{"option":2,"content":"Rates of death from illnesses have risen due to global warming."},{"option":3,"content":"Malnutrition has caused serious health problems in poor countries."},{"option":4,"content":"Economic trends have to do with population and natural disasters."}]},{"id":102914,"title":"What do we learn about the Forum’s report from the passage?","textExplain":"定位：根据Forum’s report和上一题的位置，将本题定位在第二段之后。\n解析：第三段提到了论坛发布的报告引发的反应，the report drew criticism from some experts on climate and risk “该报道遭到了一些气候和风险专家的批评”，A与原文表述一致，changed与原文的questioned同义，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It was challenged by some climate and risk experts."},{"option":2,"content":"It aroused a lot of interest in the scientific circles."},{"option":3,"content":"It was warmly received by environmentalists."},{"option":4,"content":"It caused a big stir in developing countries."}]},{"id":102915,"title":"What does Dr. Pielke say about the Forum’s report?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中的Pielke 和the Forum's report将本题出处定位到第五段首句。\n解析：该句Pielke博士指出，论坛发布的报告是“一个方法论的尴尬”，原因在于，there was no way to distinguish deaths or economic losses related to human-driven global warming，“没有办法分辨出哪些死亡和经济损失与人为因素导致的全球变暖相关”。由此可见，Pielke 博士认为论坛发布的报告是无效的，根本无法获得准确的数据，故答案为B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Its statistics look embarrassing."},{"option":2,"content":"It is invalid in terms of methodology."},{"option":3,"content":"It deserves our closest attention."},{"option":4,"content":"Its conclusion is purposely exaggerated."}]},{"id":102916,"title":"What is Soren Andreasen’s view of the report?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中的 Soren Andreasen和the report将本题出处定位到第六段。\n解析： Soren Andreasen说the report was aimed at world leaders，发布该报告针对的是世界各国领导人，即正确答案为D。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Its conclusions are based on carefully collected data."},{"option":2,"content":"It is vulnerable to criticism if the statistics are closely examined."},{"option":3,"content":" It will give rise to heated discussions at the Copenhagen conference."},{"option":4,"content":"Its rough estimates are meant to draw the attention of world leaders."}]},{"id":102917,"title":"What does Kofi Annan say should be the focus of the Copenhagen conference?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中的Annan和focus将本题出处定位到末段首句。\n解析： Kofi Annan认为哥本哈根大会核心议题是，focus on increasing the flow of money from rich to poor regions to help reduce their vulnerability to climate hazards，“富裕国家资助贫困地区减少气候灾害”。故答案为D。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"How rich and poor regions can share responsibility in curbing global warming."},{"option":2,"content":"How human and economic losses from climate change can be reduced."},{"option":3,"content":"How emissions of heat-trapping gases can be reduced on a global scale."},{"option":4,"content":"How rich countries can better help poor regions reduce climate hazards."}]}]},{"id":4910,"name":"2011.12 Passage One","content":"    Boys' schools are the perfect place to teach young men to express their emotions and involve them in activities such as art, dance and music.\nFar from the traditional image of a culture of aggressive masculinity (阳刚), the absence of girls gives boys the chance to develop without pressure to conform to a stereotype, a US study says.\n    Boys at single-sex schools were said to be more likely to get involved in cultural and artistic activities that helped develop their emotional expressiveness, rather than feeling they had to conform to the \"boy code\" of hiding their emotions to be a \"real man\".\n    The findings of the study so against received wisdom that boys do better when taught alongside girls.\n    Tony Little, headmaster of Eton, warned that boys were being failed by the British education system because it had become too focused on girls.

Because boys generally have more acute vision, learn best through touch, and are physically more active, they need to be given \"hands-on\" lessons where they are allowed to walk around. \"Boys in mixed schools view classical music as feminine (女性的) and prefer the modem genre (类型) in which violence and sexism are major themes,\" James wrote.\n    Single-sex education also made it less likely that boys would feel they had to conform to a stereotype that men should be \"masterful and in charge\" in relationships. \"In mixed schools, boys feel compelled to act like men before they understand themselves well enough to know what that means, \" the study reported.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102918,"title":"The author believes that a single-sex school would __________.","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的single-sex school将本题定位于第三段。\n解析：该段提到，单一性别的学校里的男孩to be more likely to get involved in cultural and artistic activities that helped develop their emotional expressiveness， “更有可能参加到文艺活动中，这有利于发展他们的情感表达”，由此可知单行学校能让男生更自由的表达他们的情感，故答案为B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"force boys to hide their emotions to be \"real men\""},{"option":2,"content":"encourage boys to express their emotions more freely"},{"option":3,"content":"help to cultivate masculine aggressiveness in boys"},{"option":4,"content":"naturally reinforce in boys the traditional image of a man"}]},{"id":102919,"title":"It is commonly believed that in a mixed school boys __________.","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的commonly believed和boys 将本题定位于第四段。\n解析：题干的commonly believed对应原文的received wisdom。本段指出了人们通常的看法是boys do better when taught alongside girls，也就是说男生在与女生一起学习的时候表现更好，故选D。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"behave more responsibly"},{"option":2,"content":"grow up more healthily"},{"option":3,"content":"receive a better education"},{"option":4,"content":"perform relatively better"}]},{"id":102920,"title":"What does Tony Little say about the British education system?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的Tony Little 和British education system将本题定位于第五段第一句。\n解析：该句提到，Tony Little认为it had become too focused on girls英国教育系统太关注女生了，即没有给男生足够的关注，故答案为C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It fails more boys than girls academically."},{"option":2,"content":"It focuses more on mixed school education."},{"option":3,"content":"It fails to give boys the attention they need."},{"option":4,"content":"It places more pressure on boys than on girls."}]},{"id":102921,"title":"According to Abigail James, one of the advantages of single-sex schools is __________.","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的 Abigail James和single-sex schools将本题定位于第七段。\n解析：该段提到，Abigail James认为在单性学校老师可以tailor lessons to boys' learning style，为男孩量身定制学习方式，故答案为B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"teaching can be designed to promote boys' team spirit"},{"option":2,"content":"teaching can be tailored to suit the characteristics of boys"},{"option":3,"content":"boys can choose to learn whatever they are interested in"},{"option":4,"content":"boys can focus on their lessons without being distracted"}]},{"id":102922,"title":"Which of the following is characteristic of boys according to Abigail James' report?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的 characteristic of boys和James'将本题定位于第八段第二句。\n解析：该处提到Abigail James认为男生一般眼光更敏锐，通过实际接触学习效果好，而且更好动，这些都是男孩子的特性。A选项中的have sharper vision对应原文中的 have more acute vision，故选择A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They have sharper vision."},{"option":2,"content":"They enjoy being in charge."},{"option":3,"content":"They are violent and sexist."},{"option":4,"content":"They conform to stereotypes."}]}]},{"id":4915,"name":"2011.12 Passage Two","content":"    It's an annual argument.

I say you only live once and we work hard and what's the point if you can't go on holiday. The joy of a recession means no argument next year—we just won't go.\n    Since money is known to be one of the things most likely to bring a relationship to its knees, we should be grateful. For many families the recession means more than not booking a holiday.  A YouGov poll of 2, 000 people found 22% said they were arguing more with their partners because of concerns about money. What's less clear is whether divorce and separation rates rise in a recession—financial pressures mean couples argue more but make splitting up less affordable. A recent research shows arguments about money were especially damaging to couples. Disputes were characterised by intense verbal (言语上的) aggression, tended to be repeated and not resolved, and made men, more than women, extremely angry.\n    Kim Stephenson, an occupational psychologist, believes money is such a big deal because of what it symbolises, which may be different things to men and women. \"People can say the same things about money but have different ideas of what it's for,\" he explains. \"They'll say it's to save, to spend, for security, for freedom, to show someone you love them.\" He says men are more likely to see money as a way of buying status and of showing their parents that they've achieved something.\n    \"The biggest problem is that couples assume each other knows what's going on with their finances, but they don't.

If the Great Depression is any guide, we may see a drop in our skyhigh divorce rate. But this won't necessarily represent an increase in happy marriages. In the long run, the Depression weakened American families, and the current crisis will probably do the same.\n    We tend to think of the Depression as a time when families pulled together to survive huge job losses. By 1932, when nearly one-quarter of the workforce was unemployed, the divorce rate had declined by around 25% from 1929. But this doesn't mean people were suddenly happier with their marriages. Rather, with incomes decreasing and insecure jobs, unhappy couples often couldn't afford to divorce. They feared neither spouse could manage alone.\n    Today, given the job losses of the past year, fewer unhappy couples will risk starting separate households. Furthermore, the housing market meltdown will make it more difficult for them to finance their separations by selling their homes.\n    After financial disasters family members also tend to do whatever they can to help each other and their communities. A 1940 book, The Unemployed Man and His Family, described a family in which the husband initially reacted to losing his job \"with tireless search for work.\" He was always active, looking for odd jobs to do.\n    The problem is that such an impulse is hard to sustain. Across the country, many similar families were unable to maintain the initial boost in morale(士气). For some, the hardships of life without steady work eventually overwhelmed their attempts to keep their families together. The divorce rate rose again during the rest of the decade as the recovery took hold.\n    Millions of American families may now be in the initial stage of their responses to the current crisis, working together and supporting one another through the early months of unemployment.\n    Today's economic crisis could well generate a similar number of couples whose relationships have been irreparably (无法弥补地) ruined.

Facebook then attempts to make money by selling their data to advertisers that want to send targeted messages.\n    Most Facebook users don't realize this is happening. Even if they know what the company is up to, they still have no idea what they're paying for Facebook, because people don't really know what their personal data is worth.\n    The biggest problem, however, is that the company keeps changing the rules. Early on, you could keep everything private. That was the great thing about Facebook—you could create your own little private network. Last year, the company changed its privacy rules so that many things —your city, your photo, your friends' names—were set, by default (默认), to be shared with everyone on the Internet.\n    According to Facebook's vice-president Elliot Schrage, the company is simply making changes to improve its service, and if people don't share information, they have a \"less satisfying experience.\"\n    Some critics think this is more about Facebook looking to make more money. Its original business model, which involved selling ads and putting them at the side of the page, totally failed. Who wants to look at ads when they're online connecting with their friends?\n    The privacy issue has already landed Facebook in hot water in Washington.

That’s bad for the economy, of course. And it may be especially discouraging if you happen to be looking for a job or hoping to change careers right now. But it actually shouldn’t matter to you nearly as much as you think.\n    That’s because job growth numbers don’t matter to job hunters as much as job turnover（人员更替） data. After all, existing jobs open up every day due to promotions, resignations, terminations（解雇）, and retirements. (Yes, people are retiring even in this economy.) In both good times and bad, turnover creates more openings than economic growth does. Even in June of 2007, when the economy was still moving ahead, job growth was only 132,000, while turnover was 4.7 million!\n    And as it turns out, even today—with job growth near zero — over 4 million job hunters are being hired every month.\n    I don’t mean to imply that overall job growth doesn’t have an impact on one’s ability to land a job. It’s true that if total employment were higher, it would mean more jobs for all of us to choose from (and compete for). And it’s true that there are currently more people applying for each available job opening, regardless of whether it’s a new one or not.\n    But what often distinguishes those who land jobs from those who don’t is their ability to stay motivated.

So it makes sense that the elderly should be routinely screened for new tumors—or doesn’t it?\n    While such vigilant（警觉的）tracking of cancer is a good thing in general, researchers are increasingly questioning whether all of this testing is necessary for the elderly. With the percentage of people over age 65 expected to nearly double by 2050, it’s important to weigh the health benefits of screening against the risks and costs of routine testing.\n    In many cases, screening can lead to surgeries to remove cancer, while the cancers themselves may be slow-growing and may not pose serious health problems in patients’ remaining years. But the message that everyone must screen for cancer has become so deep-rooted that when health care experts recommended that women under 50 and over 74 stop screening for breast cancer, it caused a riotous reaction among doctors, patients and advocacy groups.\n    It’s hard to uproot deeply held beliefs about cancer screening with scientific data. Certainly, there are people over age 75 who have had cancers detected by routine screening, and gained several extra years of life because of treatment. And clearly, people over age 75 who have other risk factors for cancer, such as a family history or prior personal experience with the disease, should continue to get screened regularly. But for the remainder, the risk of cancer, while increased at the end of life, must be balanced with other factors like remaining life expectancy（预期寿命）.\n    A recent study suggests that doctors start to make more objective decisions about who will truly benefit from screening—especially considering the explosion of the elderly that will soon swell our population.\n    It’s not an easy calculation to make, but one that makes sense for all patients. Dr. Otis Brawley said, “Many doctors are ordering screening tests purely to cover themselves. We need to think about the rational use of health care.”\n    That means making some difficult decisions with elderly patients, and going against the misguided belief that when it comes to health care, more is always better.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102943,"title":"Why do doctors recommend routine cancer screening for elderly people?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的 routine cancer screening将本题定位于第一段。\n解析：该段第一句指出，Our risk of cancer rises dramatically as we age，随着年龄增长我们患癌症的几率越来越大。由此可知，老年人面临较大的癌症危险，故正确选项为D。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is believed to contribute to long life."},{"option":2,"content":"It is part of their health care package."},{"option":3,"content":"The elderly are more sensitive about their health."},{"option":4,"content":"The elderly are in greater danger of tumor growth."}]},{"id":102944,"title":"How do some researchers now look at routine cancer screening for the elderly?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的 researchers将本题定位于第二段第一句。\n解析：定位句中，researchers are increasingly questioning whether all of this testing is necessary for the elderly，研究人员对这种检查的必要性产生越来越多的质疑，由此可知，研究人员们对此类检查的必要性持怀疑态度，故正确选项为C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It adds too much to their medical bills."},{"option":2,"content":"It helps increase their life expectancy."},{"option":3,"content":"They are doubtful about its necessity."},{"option":4,"content":"They think it does more harm than good."}]},{"id":102945,"title":"What is the conventional view about women screening for breast cancer?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的breast cancer将本题定位于第三段第二句。\n解析：该句提到，the message that everyone must screen for cancer has become so deep-rooted每个人都应该进行癌症筛查的观念已经根深蒂固。可知传统的观点是，对于成年女性来说，检查乳腺癌是必须的，故正确选项为B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It applies to women over 50."},{"option":2,"content":"It is a must for adult women."},{"option":3,"content":"It is optional for young women."},{"option":4,"content":"It doesn’t apply to women over 74."}]},{"id":102946,"title":"Why do many doctors prescribe routine screening for cancer?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的 doctors prescribe routine screening将本题定位于第六段第二句。\n解析：该句指出，Many doctors are ordering screening tests purely to cover themselves，很多医生让病人进行癌症筛查，只是为了保护自己，故正确选项为A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They want to protect themselves against medical disputes."},{"option":2,"content":"They want to take advantage of the medical care system."},{"option":3,"content":"They want data for medical research."},{"option":4,"content":"They want their patients to suffer less."}]},{"id":102947,"title":"What does the author say is the general view about health care?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的general view将本题定位于第七段。\n解析：该段指出，the misguided belief that when it comes to health care, more is always better，传统上认为医疗保健越多越好，这是被误导的观念，故正确选项为A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The more, the better."},{"option":2,"content":"Prevention is better than cure."},{"option":3,"content":"Better early than late."},{"option":4,"content":"Better care, longer life."}]}]},{"id":4940,"name":"2012.12 (Passage One 卷二)","content":"    I’ve worked in the factories surrounding my hometown every summer since I graduated from high school, but making the transition(转变)between school and full-time blue-collar work during the break never gets any easier. For a student like me who considers any class before noon to be uncivilized, getting to a factory by 6 o’clock each morning is torture. My friends never seem to understand why I’m so relieved to be back at school or that my summer vacation has been anything but a vacation.\n    There’re few people as self-confident as a college student who has never been out in the real world. People my age always seem to overestimate the value of their time and knowledge. In fact, all the classes did not prepare me for my battles with the machine I ran in the plant, which would jam whenever I absent-mindedly put in a part backward or upside down.\n    The most stressful thing about blue-collar life is knowing your job could disappear overnight. Issues like downsizing(裁员)and overseas relocation had always seemed distant to me until my co-workers told me that the unit I was working in would shut down within six months and move to Mexico, where people would work for 60 cents an hour.\n    After working 12-hour shifts in a factory, the other options have become only too clear. When I’m back at the university, skipping classes and turning in lazy re-writes seems too irresponsible after seeing what I would be doing without school. All the advice and public-service announcements about the value of an education that used to sound stale now ring true.\n    These lessons I’m learning, however valuable, are always tinged(带有)with a sense of guilt. Many people pass their lives in the places I briefly work, spending 30 years where I spend only two months at a time. “This job pays well, but it’s hell on the body,” said one co-worker. “Study hard and keep reading,” she added.\n    My experiences in the factories have inspired me to make the most of my college years before I enter the real world for good.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102948,"title":"How did the author look back on his summer days while at college?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的look back和at college定位到首段最后一句。\n解析：事实细节题。在第一段最后，作者明确提出他的暑假has been anything but a vacation, 根本算不上假期，可知他的暑假很辛苦，故正确选项为B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They brought him nothing but torture."},{"option":2,"content":"They were no holiday for him at all."},{"option":3,"content":"They were a relief from his hard work at school."},{"option":4,"content":"They offered him a chance to know more people."}]},{"id":102949,"title":"What does the author say about college students?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的college students定位到第二段前两句。\n解析：事实细节题。文章第二段第一句提到，There’re few people as self-confident as a college student who has never been out in the real world，很少有人像从来没步入真实社会的大学生一样自信。隐含的意思是大学生过于自信。C中的think too highly of是文中overestimate的同义转述，故正确选项为C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They expect too much from the real world."},{"option":2,"content":"They have little interest in blue-collar life."},{"option":3,"content":"They think too highly of themselves."},{"option":4,"content":"They are confident of their future."}]},{"id":102950,"title":"What, according to the author, is most frustrating for blue-collar workers?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的most frustrating定位到第三段第一句。\n解析：事实细节题。文章第三段第一句指出，The most stressful thing about blue-collar life is knowing your job could disappear overnight，蓝领工人生活中压力最大的事情是知道自己可能会一夜之间丢掉工作，即他们对自己的工作没有安全感，故正确选项为B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They do not get decent pay."},{"option":2,"content":"They do not have job security."},{"option":3,"content":"They have to wok 12-hour shifts."},{"option":4,"content":"They have to move from place to place."}]},{"id":102951,"title":"In what important way has the author’s work experience changed him?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的work experience和changed定位到第四段第二句。\n解析：事实细节题。定位句中skipping classes and turning in lazy re-writes seems too irresponsible after seeing what I would be doing without school，作者在经历过校外的工作经验之后，认识到逃课和怠学是不负责任的行为，可知作者开始认识到学业的重要性了，故正确选项为D。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He learned to be more practical."},{"option":2,"content":"He acquired a sense of urgency."},{"option":3,"content":"He came to respect blue-collar workers."},{"option":4,"content":"He came to appreciate his college education."}]},{"id":102952,"title":"Why does the author feel somewhat guilty?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的guilty定位到第五段前两句。\n解析：推理判断题。第五段第一句Many people pass their lives in the places I briefly work, spending 30 years where I spend only two months at a time，很多人只能一辈子在工厂做工，而自己仅仅在工厂待两个月，之后会回学校接受教育。可知意识到蓝领工人与自己的命运的巨大差异，让作者感到内疚，故正确选项为A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He realizes there is a great divide between his life and that of blue-collar workers."},{"option":2,"content":"He looks down upon the mechanical work at the assembly line."},{"option":3,"content":"He has not done much to help his co-workers at the factory."},{"option":4,"content":"He has stayed at school just for the purpose of escaping from real world."}]}]},{"id":4945,"name":"2012.12 (Passage Two 卷二)","content":"    Are people suffering from gadget(小器具)overload? Are they exhausted by the consumer equivalent of the brain fatigue—information overload—that is caused by constant updates of devices and online media?\n    Underwrites Laboratories issued a report last week that found 48% of consumers “feel high-tech manufactures bring new products to market faster than people need them.”\n    There are two possible explanations. The first, obvious one is that the pace of innovation(创新)is too fast for consumers. The second, less obvious one is that, in fact, innovation is too slow. That is, the new offerings companies are pushing out the door every six months or so are me-too products or ones with just a couple of new features. Marketing schedules, not product innovation, are driving the corporate(公司的) train. Manufactures in America valued “speed to market” more than in other countries, the report found.\n    Sara Greenstein, Underwriters Laboratories’ chief strategy officer, offered her interpretation of the survey results, “Innovation is too fast only if corners are cut.”\n    For the high-tech sector, there are a few other interesting findings. Consumers are less concerned about safety in high-tech products than categories like fresh and processed food. But their top safety concerns are emissions and wireless radio waves. Many people, it seems, are uneasy living in a thickening cloud of radio waves from mobile phone towers and the gadgets they communicate with.\n    A finding that was a bit surprising is that to consumers, the inner parts of high-tech devices do apparently matter. Some 55% of consumers, according to the report, said they are “more concerned about where high-tech components come from than where the product was assembled.”\n    The report doesn’t really say how that information would affect consumer buying decisions. It could be complicated. Manufacturing companies on average rely on more than 35 contract suppliers around the world to create a single product. That number would be higher for a smartphone or laptop.\n    But maybe some sort of supply-chain labeling showing where parts come from in a product? “We’re working on it,” Ms. Greenstein said.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102953,"title":"What is the finding in Underwriters Laboratories’ report about many consumers?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的finding 和Underwriters Laboratories’ report定位到第二段第一句。\n解析：事实细节题。第二段提到美国保险商实验室发布的一项报告指出，48% of consumers feel high-tech manufactures bring new products to market faster than people need them，48%的消费者认为高科技制造商向市场投放新产品的速度快于人们的需求度。即他们认为产品更新速度比人们所需快，故正确选项为C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They are exhausted by the information overload."},{"option":2,"content":"They are tired of the constant updating of devices."},{"option":3,"content":"They feel products are updated faster than needed."},{"option":4,"content":"They have difficulty following high-tech innovations."}]},{"id":102954,"title":"What does the author mean by “me-too products”?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的me-too products定位到第三段第四句。\n解析：语义理解题。文章第三段第四句指出各公司每隔半年左右退出的新产品是mo-too products or ones with just a couple of new features，后者意为“仅有很少新特征的产品”，也可以理解为“没有很大区别的产品”，故正确选项为A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Products with no substantial difference."},{"option":2,"content":"Products tailored to individual users."},{"option":3,"content":"Products everyone is eager to possess."},{"option":4,"content":"Products companies complete to make."}]},{"id":102955,"title":"What do American businesses give priority to when marketing their products?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的American business, give priority和marketing定位到第三段。\n解析：事实细节题。文章第三段最后一句提到，Manufactures in America valued “speed to market” more than in other countries，美国制造商比其他国家的制造商更加注重“加快进入市场的速度”。也就是说，美国优先考虑的是向市场投放产品的速度，故正确选项为B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The constant updating of their technology."},{"option":2,"content":"The speed of putting them on the market."},{"option":3,"content":"The quality of their new products."},{"option":4,"content":"The pace of product innovation."}]},{"id":102956,"title":"What is the consumers’ chief concern about high-tech products?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的chief concern, high-tech products定位到第五段第三句。\n解析：事实细节题。文章第五段提到了消费者关心的一些问题，第三句说But their top safety concerns are emissions and wireless radio waves，他们最关心的安全问题是辐射和无线电波，故正确选项为D。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"User-friendliness."},{"option":2,"content":"Product quality."},{"option":3,"content":"Place of assembly."},{"option":4,"content":"Radio emissions."}]},{"id":102957,"title":"Why does the author suggest supply-chain labeling?","textExplain":"定位： 由题干中的supply-chain labeling定位到文章第六段段第一句（the inner parts of high-tech devices）。\n解析：推理判断题。文章第六段最后一句提到more concerned about where high-tech components come from than where the product was assembled，消费者更关心高科技组件的来源地而不是产品的组装地，即消费者会留意产品标签上的信息故正确选项为C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It guarantees the safe shipping of products."},{"option":2,"content":"It promotes the competitiveness of the supplier."},{"option":3,"content":"Consumers care about where components are made."},{"option":4,"content":"Consumers tend to buy products they are familiar with."}]}]}]}
