They record where you’re going, how fast you're traveling and whether everything on your airplane is functioning normally. Their ability to withstand almost any disaster makes them seem like something out of a comic book. They're known as the black box.\n    When planes fall from the sky, as a Yemeni airliner did on its way to Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean June 30, 2009, the black box is the best bet for identifying what went wrong. So when a French submarine (潜水艇) detected the device's homing signal five days later, the discovery marked a huge step toward determining the cause of a tragedy in which 152 passengers were killed.\n    In 1958, Australian scientist David Warren developed a flight-memory recorder that would track basic information like altitude and direction. That was the first model for a black box, which became a requirement on all U.S. commercial flights by 1960. Early models often failed to withstand crashes, however, so in 1965 the device was completely redesigned and moved to the rear of the plane–the area least subject to impact–from its original position in the landing wells (起落架舱). That same year, the Federal Aviation Authority required that the boxes, which were never actually black, be painted orange or yellow to aid visibility.\n    Modern airplanes have two black boxes: a voice recorder, which tracks pilots' conversations, and a flight-data recorder, which monitors fuel levels, engine noises and other operating functions that help investigators reconstruct the aircraft's final moments. Placed in an insulated (隔绝的) case and surrounded by a quarter-inch-thick panels of stainless steel, the boxes can withstand massive force and temperatures up to 2,000℉. When submerged, they're also able to emit signals from depths of 20,000 ft. Experts believe the boxes from Air France Flight 447, which crashed near Brazil on June 1,2009, are in water nearly that deep, but statistics say they're still likely to turn up. In the approximately 20 deep-sea crashes over the past 30 years, only one plane's black boxes were never recovered.

Is there power in positive thinking?\n    Researchers in Canada just published a study in the journal Psychological Science that says trying to get people to think more positively can actually have the opposite effect: it can simply highlight how unhappy they are.\n    The study's authors, Joanne Wood and John Lee of the University of Waterloo and Elaine Perunovic of the University of New Brunswick, begin by citing older research showing that when people get feedback which they believe is overly positive, they actually feel worse, not better. If you tell your dim friend that he has the potential of an Einstein, you're just underlining his faults. In one 1990s experiment, a team including psychologist Joel Cooper of Princeton asked participants to write essays opposing funding for the disabled. When the essayists were late praised for their sympathy, they felt even worse about what they had written.\n    In this experiment, Wood, Lee and Perunovic measured 68 students' self-esteem. The participants were then asked to write down their thoughts and feelings for four minutes. Every 15 seconds, one group of students heard a bell. When it rang, they were supposed to tell themselves, \"I am lovable.\"\n    Those with low self-esteem didn't feel better after the forced self-affirmation. In fact, their moods turned significantly darker than those of members of the control group, who weren't urged to think positive thoughts.\n    The paper provides support for newer forms of psychotherapy (心理治疗) that urge people to accept their negative thoughts and feelings rather than fight them. In the fighting, we not only often fail but can make things worse. Meditation (静思) techniques, in contrast, can teach people to put their shortcomings into a larger, more realistic perspective. Call it the power of negative thinking.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102408,"title":"What do we learn from the first paragraph about the self-help industry?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干可定位到第一段第一句话。\n解析：根据The $11 billion self-help industry is built on the idea that you should turn negative thoughts like \"I never do anything right\" into positive ones like \"I can succeed.\"可知销售收入达110亿美元的自主产业的思想基础是你应该把“我什么事都做不好”之类的消极思维转变成“我能成功”之类的积极思维，也就是说自主产业是以积极思维为基础的，故正确答案是B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is a highly profitable industry."},{"option":2,"content":"It is based on the concept of positive thinking."},{"option":3,"content":"It was established by Norman Vincent Peale."},{"option":4,"content":"It has yielded positive results."}]},{"id":102409,"title":"What is the finding of the Canadian researchers?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中Canadian researchers定位到第二段。\n解析：第二段中trying to get people to think more positively can actually have the opposite effect，试图让人们更加积极地思考实际上会产生相反的效果，也就是说鼓励积极思考反而会产生反作用，产生更多的害处而非益处，故正确答案是A。 ","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Encouraging positive thinking may do more harm than good."},{"option":2,"content":"There can be no simple therapy for psychological problems."},{"option":3,"content":"Unhappy people cannot think positively."},{"option":4,"content":"The power of positive thinking is limited."}]},{"id":102410,"title":"What does the author mean by \"… you're just underlining his faults\" (Line 4, Para. 3)?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中\"… you're just underlining his faults\"可定位到第三段第二句话。\n解析：根据The study's authors, 和begin by citing older research showing that when people get feedback which they believe is overly positive, they actually feel worse, not better，可知研究人员指出如果人们得到过于肯定的反馈，实际上它们会感觉更糟，而不是更好，再根据If you tell your dim friend that he has the potential of an Einstein, you're just underlining his faults可知如果你告诉一位头脑有些迟钝的朋友他具有成为爱因斯坦的可能，那么你就是在强调他有多笨，故正确答案是C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"You are not taking his mistakes seriously enough."},{"option":2,"content":"You are pointing out the errors he has committed."},{"option":3,"content":"You are emphasizing the fact that he is not intelligent."},{"option":4,"content":"You are trying to make him feel better about his faults."}]},{"id":102411,"title":"What do we learn from the experiment of Wood, Lee and Perunovic?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中the experiment of Wood, Lee and Perunovic定位到第五段。\n解析：根据Those with low self-esteem didn't feel better after the forced self-affirmation可知实验的结果是在强加的自我肯定之后，那些自尊心差的同学并没有感觉更好，可见，强迫一个人做自我肯定不能增强他的自尊心，故正确答案是C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is important for people to continually boost their self-esteem."},{"option":2,"content":"Self-affirmation can bring a positive change to one's mood."},{"option":3,"content":"Forcing a person to think positive thoughts may lower their self-esteem."},{"option":4,"content":"People with low self-esteem seldom write down their true feelings."}]},{"id":102412,"title":"What do we learn from the last paragraph?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干可定位到最后一段。\n解析：根据Meditation (静思) techniques, in contrast, can teach people to put their shortcomings into a larger, more realistic perspective，Meditation (静思) 可以让人们正视自己的不足，即Meditation (静思)是一种心理治疗的好方法，故正确答案是B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The effects of positive thinking vary from person to person."},{"option":2,"content":"Meditation may prove to be a good form of psychotherapy."},{"option":3,"content":"Different people tend to have different ways of thinking."},{"option":4,"content":"People can avoid making mistakes through meditation."}]}]}]}
