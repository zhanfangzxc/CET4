What is it like when the days are so short?\nW: So what is it like?\nM: Well, it is cold, very cold in winter. Sometimes as cold as 26 degrees below centigrade. And of course when you go out, you’ll wrap up warm. But inside in the houses it’s always very warm, much warmer than at home. [20]Swedish people always complain that when they visit England, the houses are cold, even in a good winter.\nW: And what about the darkness?\nM: Well, yeah, around Christmas time there’s only one hour of daylight, so you really look forward to the spring. [21]It is sometimes a bit depressing. But you see the summers are amazing. From May to July in the North of Sweden the sun never sets. It’s still light in the midnight. You can walk in the mountains and read a newspaper.\nW: Oh, yeah, the land of the midnight sun.\nM: That’s right, but it’s wonderful. You want stay up all night. And the Swedes makes the most of it. Often they started work earlier in summer and then leave at about 2 or 3 in the afternoon, so that they can really enjoy the long summer evenings. [22]They’d like to work hard, but play hard, too. I think Londoners work longer hours, but I’m not sure this is a good thing.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/201112/2011-12-C1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102215,"title":"What do we learn about the man from the conversation?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n男士话中live in Sweden“住在瑞典”，home … England“家…英格兰”，与B选项Englishman living in Sweden“住在瑞典的英格兰人”构成同义替换，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He likes Sweden better than England."},{"option":2,"content":"He is an Englishman living in Sweden."},{"option":3,"content":"He visits London nearly every winter."},{"option":4,"content":"He prefers hot weather to cold weather."}]},{"id":102216,"title":"What do Swedish people complain about when they visit England in winter?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词always后面houses … cold“房子里很冷”，与C选项cold houses构成视听一致。瑞典人总是抱怨他们造访英格兰时，即使冬天天气不错，屋子里也很冷，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The bad weather."},{"option":2,"content":"The long night."},{"option":3,"content":"The cold houses."},{"option":4,"content":"The gloomy winter."}]},{"id":102217,"title":"How does the man describe the short hour of daylight around Christmas in Sweden?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词sometimes后面depressing“沮丧”，与D选项构成视听一致。男士说在圣诞节的那几天，那里白天只有一个小时的日照时间，这种天气有时令人感到沮丧，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Delightful."},{"option":2,"content":"Painful."},{"option":3,"content":"Refreshing."},{"option":4,"content":"Depressing."}]},{"id":102218,"title":"What does the man say about the Swedish people?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词but后面work hard…play hard“工作努力，玩得也尽兴”，与D选项work hard and play hard构成视听一致。男士说瑞典人他们工作很努力，但玩起来也很尽兴，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They try to earn more and spend more."},{"option":2,"content":"They like to go camping in summer."},{"option":3,"content":"They often stay up late reading."},{"option":4,"content":"They work hard and play hard."}]}]},{"id":4210,"name":"2011.12 Conversation Two","content":"W: What kind of training does one need to go into this type of job?\nM: That’s a very good question.
