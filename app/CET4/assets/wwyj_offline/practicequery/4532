Women, as outsiders, \"are more likely to think independently or at least see people outside of the economics profession as forming their peer group,\" he says.\n    The gender balance in economics is changing. One-third of economics doctorates(博士学位) now go to women.” More diversity is needed at the table when public policy is discussed,\" May says.\n    Economists do agree on some things. Female economists agree with men that Europe has too much regulation and that Wal-Mart is good for society. Male economists agree with their female colleagues that military spending is too high.\n    The genders are most divorced from each other on the question of equality for women. Male economists overwhelmingly think the wage gap between men and women is largely the result of individuals' skills, experience and voluntary choices. Female economists overwhelmingly disagree by a margin of 4-to-1.\n    The biggest disagreement: 76% of women say faculty opportunities in economics favor men. Male economists point the opposite way: 80% say women are favored or the process is neutral.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":103279,"title":"What is the finding of the new study?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中的new study定位至第一段。\n解析：第一段说，A new study shows a large gender gap on economic policy among the nation’s professional economists，“最近的一项研究表明，国内职业经济学家在经济政策这个问题上存在着很大的性别差异”。可见，新研究的调查结果是男女经济学家在经济政策问题上差别很大，故D为正确答案。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The gender divide is a big concern of the general public.
