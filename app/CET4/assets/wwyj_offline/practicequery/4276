[23] Trading in financial markets combines both.\nW: How do you relax in the evening?\nM: I very rarely do anything work-related. So it’s easy to escape the markets. I generally go to the gym or go for a run, especially if I’ve had a bad day. I always cook a meal, rather than have a take-away, to do something my brain would regard as [24] creative.\nW: Do you think what you do to relax is an effective way to beat stress?\nM: I don’t think there’s a specific rule about how to beat stress. I generally find that what I do is effective for me.\nW: Would you consider changing your job because of the high-stress factor?\nM: I have considered leaving my job due to stress-related factors. [25] However, I do think that an element of stress is a good thing, and if used in the right way, can actually be a positive thing.\nW: What do you enjoy about the stressful aspects of your job?\nM: Having said all that, I do actually enjoy an element of uncertainty. I enjoy a mental challenge. Trading generates a wide range of emotions second by second. How you deal with and manage those emotions dictates short-medium, and long term trading performance and success.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/200912/2009-12-C2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102191,"title":"What is the man’s job?
