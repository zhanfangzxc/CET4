Rightly so. But selfishly, I'm more fascinated by Michelle Obama and what she might be able to do, not just for this country, but for me as an African-American woman. As the potential First Lady, she would have the world's attention. And that means that for the first time people will have a chance to get up close and personal with the type of African-American woman they so rarely see.\n    Usually, the lives of black women go largely unexamined. The prevailing theory seems to be that we're all hot-tempered single mothers who can't keep a man. Even in the world of make-believe, black women still can't escape the stereotype of being eye-rolling, oversexed females raised by our never-married, alcoholic (酗酒的) mothers.\n    These images have helped define the way all black women are viewed, including Michelle Obama. Before she ever gets the chance to commit to a cause, charity or foundation as First Lady, her most urgent and perhaps most complicated duty may be simply to be herself.\n    It won't be easy. Because few mainstream publications have done in-depth features on regular African-American women, little is known about who we are, what we think and what we face on a regular basis. For better or worse, Michelle will represent us all.\n    Just as she will have her critics, she will also have millions of fans who usually have little interest in the First Lady. Many African-American blogs have written about what they'd like to see Michelle bring to the White House—mainly showing the world that a black woman can support her man and raise a strong black family. Michelle will have to work to please everyone—an impossible task. But for many African-American women like me, just a little of her poise (沉着), confidence and intelligence will go a long way in changing an image that's been around for far too long.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102393,"title":"Why does Michelle Obama hold a strong fascination for the author?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中 fascination定位到第一段。\n解析：文章第一段的最后一句话说people will have a chance to get up close and personal with the type of African-American woman they so rarely see人们将会亲眼看到一个他们很少见到的非裔女性的形象，从句中可以推测Michelle Obama有望以自己的人格魅力展现一个全新的形象，故正确答案是C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"She serves as a role model for African-American women."},{"option":2,"content":"She possesses many admirable qualities becoming a First Lady."},{"option":3,"content":"She will present to the world a new image of African-American women."},{"option":4,"content":"She will pay closer attention to the interests of African-American women."}]},{"id":102394,"title":"What is the common stereotype of African-American women according to the author?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中stereotype定位到第二段最后一句话。\n解析：文章第二段提到，黑人女性仍旧摆脱不了人们的思维定式，然后列举了一些非裔女性的印象，包括她们的脾气，她们的家庭，从中可以推断出非裔女性是一个劣势群体，不同于社会的主流，故正确答案是B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They are victims of family violence."},{"option":2,"content":"They are of an inferior social group."},{"option":3,"content":"They use quite a lot of body language."},{"option":4,"content":"They live on charity and social welfare."}]},{"id":102395,"title":"What do many African-Americans write about in their blogs?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中blogs定位到最后一段第二句。\n解析：文章最后一段mainly showing the world that a black woman can support her man and raise a strong black family，向世界展示黑人女性有能力相夫教子，故正确答案是D。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Whether Michelle can live up to the high expectations of her fans."},{"option":2,"content":"How Michelle should behave as a public figure."},{"option":3,"content":"How proud they are to have a black woman in the White House."},{"option":4,"content":"What Michelle should do as wife and mother in the White House."}]},{"id":102396,"title":"What does the author say about Michelle Obama as a First Lady?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干和选项的内容可定位到最后一段倒数第二句。\n解析：此题采用排除法，A选项出现在文章最后一段，但作者只说很多人迷Michelle Obama，但并没有提及她本人的态度；B和D选项在文中没有出现；而C选项出现在文章最后一段第三句话，Michelle Obama需要努力的取悦每一个人，但这是不可能的事，与C选项意思相符，故正确答案是C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"However many fans she has, she should remain modest."},{"option":2,"content":"She shouldn't disappoint the African-American community."},{"option":3,"content":"However hard she tries, she can't expect to please everybody."},{"option":4,"content":"She will give priority to African-American women's concerns."}]},{"id":102397,"title":"What do many African-American women hope Michelle Obama will do?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干和选项的内容可定位到最后一段最后一句话。\n解析：定位句her poise (沉着), confidence and intelligence will go a long way in changing an image that's been around for far too long她的沉着、信心、智慧将会改变存在已久的偏见，故正确答案是A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Help change the prevailing view about black women."},{"option":2,"content":"Help her husband in the task of changing America."},{"option":3,"content":"Outshine previous First Ladies."},{"option":4,"content":"Fully display her fine qualities."}]}]},{"id":4391,"name":"2009.12 Passage Two","content":"    When next year's crop of high-school graduates arrive at Oxford University in the fall of 2009, they'll be joined by a new face: Andrew Hamilton, the 55-year-old provost (教务长) of Yale, who'll become Oxford's vice-chancellor—a position equivalent to university president in America.\n    Hamilton isn't the only educator crossing the Atlantic. Schools in France, Egypt, Singapore, etc. have also recently made top-level hires from abroad. Higher education has become a big and competitive business nowadays, and like so many businesses, it's gone global. Yet the talent flow isn't universal. High-level personnel tend to head in only one direction: outward from America.\n    The chief reason is that American schools don't tend to seriously consider looking abroad. For example, when the board of the University of Colorado searched for a new president, it wanted a leader familiar with the state government, a major source of the university's budget. \"We didn't do any global consideration,\" says Patricia Hayes, the board's chair. The board ultimately picked Brace Benson, a 69-year-old Colorado businessman and political activist (活动家) who is likely to do well in the main task of modern university presidents: fund-raising. Fund-raising is a distinctively American thing, since U.S. schools rely heavily on donations. The fund-raising ability is largely a product of experience and necessity.\n    Many European universities, meanwhile, are still mostly dependent on government funding. But government support has failed to keep pace with rising student numbers. The decline in government support has made fund-raising an increasingly necessary ability among administrators, and has hiring committees hungry for Americans.\n    In the past few years, prominent schools around the world have joined the trend. In 2003, when Cambridge University appointed Alison Richard, another former Yale provost, as its vice-chancellor, the university publicly stressed that in her previous job she had overseen (监督) \"a major strengthening of Yale's financial position\".\n    Of course, fund-raising isn't the only skill outsiders offer. The globalization of education means more universities will be seeking heads with international experience of some kind to promote international programs and attract a global student body. Foreigners can offer a fresh perspective on established practices.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102398,"title":"What is the current trend in higher education discussed in the passage?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中current trend和 higher education定位到第二段最后一句。\n解析：文章一开始讲到，牛津大学邀请了来自耶鲁大学的Andrew Hamilton，而他并不是跨越大西洋的唯一一个，第二段最后一句指出，人才流动并非全球化，而是从美国到别的国家，也就是世界范围内的许多大学都在从美国招聘校长，A选项意思与此相符，故正确答案是A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Institutions worldwide are hiring administrators from the U.S."},{"option":2,"content":"A lot of political activists are being recruited as administrators."},{"option":3,"content":"American universities are enrolling more international students."},{"option":4,"content":"University presidents are paying more attention to fund-raising."}]},{"id":102399,"title":"What is the chief consideration of American universities when hiring top-level administrators?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中的the chief consideration 和 American universities定位到第三段第三句。\n解析：定位句后一句中the main task of modern university presidents: fund-raising，现代大学校长的首要任务是集资能力，故正确答案是B。 ","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Their political correctness."},{"option":2,"content":"Their ability to raise funds."},{"option":3,"content":"Their fame in academic circles."},{"option":4,"content":"Their administrative experience."}]},{"id":102400,"title":"What do we learn about European universities from the passage?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中European universities定位到第四段第一句。\n解析：定位句中Many European universities, meanwhile, are still mostly dependent on government funding许多欧洲大学，它们的资金主要来自于政府，根据这个细节可判断正确答案是D。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The tuitions they charge have been rising considerably."},{"option":2,"content":"Their operation is under strict government supervision."},{"option":3,"content":"They are strengthening their position by globalization."},{"option":4,"content":"Most of their revenues come from the government."}]},{"id":102401,"title":"Cambridge University appointed Alison Richard as its vice-chancellor chiefly because__________.","textExplain":"定位：根据题干中Cambridge University 和 Alison Richard定位到倒数第二段第二句。\n解析：文章中指出剑桥引进 Alison Richard，\"a major strengthening of Yale's financial position\"，她在强化耶鲁经济地位时起到重要作用，可知Alison Richard善于筹募资金，故正确答案是A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"she was known to be good at raising money"},{"option":2,"content":"she could help strengthen its ties with Yale"},{"option":3,"content":"she knew how to attract students overseas"},{"option":4,"content":"she had boosted Yale's academic status"}]},{"id":102402,"title":"In what way do top-level administrators from abroad contribute to university development?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干可定位到最后一段最后一句。\n解析：定位句中Foreigners can offer a fresh perspective on established practices外国人可以提供一个全新的视角，C选项意思与其相符，故正确答案是C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They can enhance the university's image."},{"option":2,"content":"They will bring with them more international faculty."},{"option":3,"content":"They will view a lot of things from a new perspective."},{"option":4,"content":"They can set up new academic disciplines."}]}]}]}
