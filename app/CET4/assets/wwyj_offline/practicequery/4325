That’s bad for the economy, of course. And it may be especially discouraging if you happen to be looking for a job or hoping to change careers right now. But it actually shouldn’t matter to you nearly as much as you think.\n    That’s because job growth numbers don’t matter to job hunters as much as job turnover（人员更替） data. After all, existing jobs open up every day due to promotions, resignations, terminations（解雇）, and retirements. (Yes, people are retiring even in this economy.) In both good times and bad, turnover creates more openings than economic growth does. Even in June of 2007, when the economy was still moving ahead, job growth was only 132,000, while turnover was 4.7 million!\nAnd as it turns out, even today—with job growth near zero — over 4 million job hunters are being hired every month.\n    I don’t mean to imply that overall job growth doesn’t have an impact on one’s ability to land a job. It’s true that if total employment were higher, it would mean more jobs for all of us to choose from (and compete for). And it’s true that there are currently more people applying for each available job opening, regardless of whether it’s a new one or not.\n    But what often distinguishes those who land jobs from those who don’t is their ability to stay motivated. They’re willing to do the hard work of identifying their valuable skills; be creative about where and how to look; learn how to present themselves to potential employers; and keep going, even after repeated rejections. The Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that 2.7 million people who wanted and were available for work hadn’t looked within the last four weeks and were no longer even classified as unemployed.\n    So don’t let the headlines fool you into giving up. Four million people get hired every month in the U.S. You can be one of them.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102453,"title":"The author tends to believe that high unemployment rate ______.","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的high unemployment rate 将本题定位于第一段。\n解析：文章第一句指出经济形势不好，失业率高，在第一段最后一句又指出，实际情况并不向人们想象的那样严重。由此可知，作者认为人们不应该因为仅仅报道中说失业率高就放弃找工作，故正确选项为C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"deprives many people of job opportunities"},{"option":2,"content":"prevents many people from changing careers"},{"option":3,"content":"should not stop people from looking for a job"},{"option":4,"content":"does not mean the US economy is worsening"}]},{"id":102454,"title":"Where do most job openings come from?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的 job openings将本题定位于第二段的第三句。\n解析：定位句明确指出，turnover creates more openings than economic growth does，工作交接产生的工作岗位比经济增涨带来的要多，故正确选项为B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Job growth."},{"option":2,"content":"Job turnover."},{"option":3,"content":"Improved economy."},{"option":4,"content":"Business expansion."}]},{"id":102455,"title":"What does the author say about overall job growth?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的overall job growth将本题定位于第四段第一句。\n解析：定位句指出，I don’t mean to imply that overall job growth doesn’t have an impact on one’s ability to land a job，“我”并不是说整体就业增长率对个体找工作没有影响，即作者认为总体的职位增长对找工作有影响但影响不大，故正确选项为A。.","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It doesn’t have much effect on individual job seekers."},{"option":2,"content":"It increases people’s confidence in the economy."},{"option":3,"content":"It gives a ray of hope to the unemployed."},{"option":4,"content":"It doesn’t mean greater job security for the employed."}]},{"id":102456,"title":"What is the key to landing a job according to the author?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的key和landing a job将本题定位于第五段第一句。\n解析：定位句指出，成功人的特点是愿意努力发现自己的技能、有创新的精神、知道如何向雇主展示自己并且在多次被拒之后任然坚持不懈，换句话说，坚持不懈才是成功的关键，故正确选项为C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Education."},{"option":2,"content":"Intelligence."},{"option":3,"content":"Persistence."},{"option":4,"content":"Experience."}]},{"id":102457,"title":"What do we learn from the passage about the unemployment figures in the US?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的unemployment figures将本题定位于第五段最后一句。\n解析：定位句中，The Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that 2.7 million people who wanted and were available for work hadn’t looked within the last four weeks and were no longer even classified as unemployed，美国劳工统计局的数据说明那些想找工作并且有能力找到工作的人，如果在过去四周的时间里没去找工作，不会记入失业人员之列，故正确选项为D。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They clearly indicate how healthy the economy is."},{"option":2,"content":"They provide the public with the latest information."},{"option":3,"content":"They warn of the structural problems in the economy."},{"option":4,"content":"They exclude those who have stopped looking for a job."}]}]},{"id":4451,"name":"2012 12 (Passage Two 卷一)","content":"    Our risk of cancer rises dramatically as we age. So it makes sense that the elderly should be routinely screened for new tumors—or doesn’t it?\n    While such vigilant（警觉的）tracking of cancer is a good thing in general, researchers are increasingly questioning whether all of this testing is necessary for the elderly. With the percentage of people over age 65 expected to nearly double by 2050, it’s important to weigh the health benefits of screening against the risks and costs of routine testing.\n    In many cases, screening can lead to surgeries to remove cancer, while the cancers themselves may be slow-growing and may not pose serious health problems in patients’ remaining years. But the message that everyone must screen for cancer has become so deep-rooted that when health care experts recommended that women under 50 and over 74 stop screening for breast cancer, it caused a riotous reaction among doctors, patients and advocacy groups.\n    It’s hard to uproot deeply held beliefs about cancer screening with scientific data. Certainly, there are people over age 75 who have had cancers detected by routine screening, and gained several extra years of life because of treatment. And clearly, people over age 75 who have other risk factors for cancer, such as a family history or prior personal experience with the disease, should continue to get screened regularly. But for the remainder, the risk of cancer, while increased at the end of life, must be balanced with other factors like remaining life expectancy（预期寿命）.\n    A recent study suggests that doctors start to make more objective decisions about who will truly benefit from screening—especially considering the explosion of the elderly that will soon swell our population.\n    It’s not an easy calculation to make, but one that makes sense for all patients. Dr. Otis Brawley said, “Many doctors are ordering screening tests purely to cover themselves. We need to think about the rational use of health care.”\nThat means making some difficult decisions with elderly patients, and going against the misguided belief that when it comes to health care, more is always better.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102458,"title":"Why do doctors recommend routine cancer screening for elderly people?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的 routine cancer screening将本题定位于第一段。\n解析：该段第一句指出，Our risk of cancer rises dramatically as we age，随着年龄增长我们患癌症的几率越来越大。由此可知，老年人面临较大的癌症危险，故正确选项为D。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is believed to contribute to long life."},{"option":2,"content":"It is part of their health care package."},{"option":3,"content":"The elderly are more sensitive about their health."},{"option":4,"content":"The elderly are in greater danger of tumor growth."}]},{"id":102459,"title":"How do some researchers now look at routine cancer screening for the elderly?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的 researchers将本题定位于第二段第一句。\n解析：定位句中，researchers are increasingly questioning whether all of this testing is necessary for the elderly，研究人员对这种检查的必要性产生越来越多的质疑，由此可知，研究人员们对此类检查的必要性持怀疑态度，故正确选项为C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It adds too much to their medical bills."},{"option":2,"content":"It helps increase their life expectancy."},{"option":3,"content":"They are doubtful about its necessity."},{"option":4,"content":"They think it does more harm than good."}]},{"id":102460,"title":"What is the conventional view about women screening for breast cancer?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的breast cancer将本题定位于第三段第二句。\n解析：该句提到，the message that everyone must screen for cancer has become so deep-rooted每个人都应该进行癌症筛查的观念已经根深蒂固。可知传统的观点是，对于成年女性来说，检查乳腺癌是必须的，故正确选项为B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It applies to women over 50."},{"option":2,"content":"It is a must for adult women."},{"option":3,"content":"t is optional for young women."},{"option":4,"content":"It doesn’t apply to women over 74."}]},{"id":102461,"title":"Why do many doctors prescribe routine screening for cancer?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的 doctors prescribe routine screening将本题定位于第六段第二句。\n解析：该句指出，Many doctors are ordering screening tests purely to cover themselves，很多医生让病人进行癌症筛查，只是为了保护自己，故正确选项为A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They want to protect themselves against medical disputes."},{"option":2,"content":"They want to take advantage of the medical care system."},{"option":3,"content":"They want data for medical research."},{"option":4,"content":"They want their patients to suffer less."}]},{"id":102462,"title":"What does the author say is the general view about health care?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的general view将本题定位于第七段。\n解析：该段指出，the misguided belief that when it comes to health care, more is always better，传统上认为医疗保健越多越好，这是被误导的观念，故正确选项为A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The more, the better."},{"option":2,"content":"Prevention is better than cure."},{"option":3,"content":"Better early than late."},{"option":4,"content":"Better care, longer life."}]}]}]}
