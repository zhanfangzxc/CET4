Last September the couple moved into a 1,500-square-foot home in Premier Gardens, a subdivision of 95 “zero-energy homes”(ZEH) just outside town. Now they’re actually eager to see their electricity bills. The grand total over the 10 months they’ve lived in the three-bedroom house: $75. For the past two months they haven’t paid a cent.\n    ZEH communities are the leading edge of technologies that might someday create houses that produce as much energy as they consume. Premier Gardens is one of a half-dozen subdivisions in California where every home cuts power consumption by 50%, mostly by using low-power appliances and solar panels.\n    Aside from the panels on the roof, Premier Gardens looks like a community of conventional homes. But inside, special windows cut power bills by blocking solar heat in summer and retaining indoor warmth in winter.\n    The rest of the energy savings comes from the solar units. They don’t just feed the home they serve. If they generate more power than the home is using, the excess flows into the utility’s power grid(电网). The residents are billed by “net metering”: they pay for the amount of power they tap off the grid, less the kilowatts(千瓦) they feed into it. If a home generates more power than it uses, the bill is zero.\n    That sounds like a bad deal for the power company, but it’s not. Solar homes produce the most power on the hot sunny afternoons when everyone rushes home to turn up the air conditioner. “ It helps us lower usage at peak power times,” says solar expert Mike Keesee. “ That lets us avoid building costly plants or buying expensive power at peak usage time.”\n    What’s not to like? Mostly the costs. The special features can add $25,000 or more to the purchase price of a house. Tax breaks bring the cost down, especially in California, but in many states ZEHS can be prohibitively expensive. For the consumer, it’s a matter of paying now for the hardware to save later on the utilities.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102493,"title":"Why are the Gatais eager to see their electricity bills now?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的eager to see their electricity bills 定位到文章首段第三、四句。\n解析：文章首段第三、四句指出，现在他们真是迫不及待地想看到电费单。目前他们所居住的三居室10个月的电费总计为75美元，而该段第一句指出他们在搬进零耗住宅之前，每个月的电费都会超过200美元，由此可见，他们想看到电费单的原因是想知道住在零能耗住宅能省多少钱，故正确选项为A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They want to see how much they have saved."},{"option":2,"content":"They want to cut down their utility expenses."},{"option":3,"content":"They want to know if they are able to pay."},{"option":4,"content":"They want to avoid being overcharged."}]},{"id":102494,"title":"What is special about the ZEH communities?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的ZEH communities 定位到文章第二段第一句\n解析：文章第二段第一句提到，produce as much energy as they consume，建造出能源自给自足的房子。由此可见，零能耗住宅社区的特别之处是他们旨在实现能源自给自足，故正确选项为B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They have created cutting-edge technologies."},{"option":2,"content":"They aim to be self-sufficient in power supply."},{"option":3,"content":"They are subdivided into half a dozen sections."},{"option":4,"content":"They are built in harmony with the environment."}]},{"id":102495,"title":"How are the residents in the ZEH communities billed for electricity use?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的residents 和billed定位到文章第四段第四句\n解析：文章第四段第四句指出，The residents are billed by “net metering”，居民的电费账单采用“净读数制”：他们要付的电量是他们所用电网的电量减去房屋所产生的电量，故正确选项为D。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They are only charged for the amount of power the consume on rainy days."},{"option":2,"content":"They needn’t pay a single cent for their power consumption on sunny days."},{"option":3,"content":"They only pay for the excess power that flows into the utility’s power grid."},{"option":4,"content":"They pay for the electricity from the grid less their home-generated power."}]},{"id":102496,"title":"What does the “net metering” practice mean to the power company?

So says psychologist Maureen O’Sullivan from the University of San Francisco. She suggests that humans have always tried to strengthen the pair-bond to maximize(使最大化) reproductive success.\n    Many societies throughout history and around the world today have cultivated strong pressures to stay married. In those where ties to family and community are strong, lifelong marriages can be prompted by practices such as the cultural prohibition of divorce and arranged marriages that are seen as a contract between two families, not just two individuals. In modern western societies, however, the focus on individuality and independence means that people are less concerned about conforming to (遵守) the dictates of family and culture. In the absence of societal pressures to maintain pair-bonds, O’Sullivan suggests that romantic love has increasingly come to be seen as the factor that should determine who we stay with and for how long. “That’s why historically we see an increase in romantic love as a basis for forming long-term relationships,” she says.\n    According to O’Sullivan culture also shapes the sorts of feelings we expect to have, and actually do experience, when in love. Although the negative emotions associated with romantic love—fear of loss, disappointment and jealousy—are fairly consistent across cultures, the positive feelings can vary. “If you ask Japanese students to list the positive attributes they expect in a romantic partner, they rate highly things like loyalty, commitment and devotion,” says O’Sullivan. “If you ask American college women , they expect everything under the sun: in addition to being committed, partners have to be amusing, funny and a friend.”\n    We judge a potential partner according to our specific cultural expectations about what romantic love should feel like. If you believe that you have found true romance, and your culture tells you that this is what a long-term relationship should be based on, there is less need to rely on social or family pressures to keep couples together, O’Sullivan argues.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102498,"title":"What does the author say about people’s views of an ideal romantic relationship?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的an ideal romantic relationship定位到文章第一段第一句。\n解析：定位句指出，our views about what makes an ideal romantic relationship can be swayed by the society we live in，我们对于是什么造就了理想的浪漫关系的观点会受到所处的社会的影响，即每个人的观点会受到文化的影响，处在不同文化的人，其理想的浪漫观也不同，故正确选项为A。 ","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They vary from culture to culture."},{"option":2,"content":"They ensure the reproductive success."},{"option":3,"content":"They reflect the evolutionary process."},{"option":4,"content":"They are influenced by psychologists."}]},{"id":102499,"title":"We can infer from the passage that strong family and community ties__________.","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的strong family and community ties定位到文章第二段第二句\n解析：定位句指出，在那些与家庭和社区关系紧密的社会里，lifelong marriages can be prompted by practices such as the cultural prohibition of divorce and arranged marriages，终生婚姻可以通过禁止离婚的文化和家庭包办等手段来保证，由此可知，家庭和社会关系紧密的社会有助于维持稳定的婚姻，故正确选项为B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"largely rely on marriage contracts"},{"option":2,"content":"can contribute to stable marriages"},{"option":3,"content":"often run counter to romantic love"},{"option":4,"content":"make divorces virtually unacceptable"}]},{"id":102500,"title":"Without social pressures to keep pair-bonds, romantic love__________.","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的social pressure和pair-bonds定位到文章第二段第四句。\n解析：定位句中提到O’Sullivan suggests that romantic love has increasingly come to be seen as the factor that should determine who we stay with and for how long，奥沙利认为，在没有需要维系婚姻的社会压力下，浪漫越来越被视为和谁在一以及在一起多久的决定性因素。由此可知，浪漫的爱情在维系长久关系方面起着重要的作用，故正确选项为B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"will be a substitute for marriage in human relationships"},{"option":2,"content":"plays a key role in maintaining long-term relationships"},{"option":3,"content":"is likely to replace the dictates of family and society"},{"option":4,"content":"is a way to develop individuality and independence"}]},{"id":102501,"title":"O’Sullivan believes that when people from difference cultures fall in love__________.","textExplain":"定位： 由题干中的different cultures和fall in love 定位到文章第三段第一句。\n解析：定位句指出，According to O’Sullivan culture also shapes the sorts of feelings we expect to have, and actually do experience, when in love，奥沙利文认为，在恋爱时期，文化同样也会影响我们体验到的感觉。由此可知，当来自于不同文化的人们相爱是，他们对伴侣抱有的期待也会有所差异，故正确选项为A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"they expect different things from their partner"},{"option":2,"content":"they tend to exaggerate each other’s positive qualities"},{"option":3,"content":"they often fail to see each other’s negative qualities"},{"option":4,"content":"they lay more emphasis on commitment and devotion "}]},{"id":102502,"title":"We can conclude from the passage that __________.","textExplain":"定位：由选项中的 romantic love 和题目顺序定位到文章最后一段最后一句。\n解析：定位句提到，If you believe that you have found true romance, and your culture tells you that this is what a long-term relationship should be based on, there is less need to rely on social or family pressures to keep couples together，奥沙利文辩称，如果你认为你找到了真爱，而且你所处的文化也认同真爱是维系长期关系的基础，那么就没有必要依赖社会和家庭的压力来维持婚姻了，由此可知，在婚姻关系中爱情所承担的作用越来越大，故正确选项为C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"cultural differences often tear apart a family built on romantic love"},{"option":2,"content":"marriages are hard to sustain without social or family pressures"},{"option":3,"content":"romantic love is becoming increasingly important in family relationships"},{"option":4,"content":"romantic love tends to yield where family or social pressures are strong"}]}]}]}
