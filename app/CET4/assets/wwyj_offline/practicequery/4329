We’ve shared a sales job at Sonatech for about two years now.\nW: Well, how do you divide up your schedule?\nM: [19]You know we are both sales representatives and we take orders over the phone. When we started job sharing it was difficult, because we both worked all day Monday. I worked Tuesday and Thursday and Arthur worked Wednesday and Friday. The problem was that when I was in the office on Tuesday, I would talk to people. Then they would call back on Wednesday with a question. But Arthur couldn’t answer the question and he couldn’t ask me about it because I wasn’t in the office. So he had to ask the people to call me back the next day, Thursday. [20]Of course, they didn’t like to wait until the next day to have their questions answered.\nW: Yes, that sounds like a problem.\nM: So, finally we decided that Arthur would work in the mornings and I would work in the afternoons. Now if someone calls with the question for me in the morning, Arthur tells them to call me in the afternoon. This way, people get their questions answered the same day.\nW: What do you do about vacations?\nM: Well, Sonatech gives the usual two weeks of vacation to full-time employees. [21] I take a week and Arthur takes a week. \nW: It sounds like job sharing has worked out well for you.\nM: Yes, it has. We are both happy with it.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/20121202/2012-12(2)-C1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102236,"title":"What do John and Arthur do at Sonatech?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n男士话中we take orders over the phone“我们通过打电话接订单”，与A选项Make phone calls to promote sales“打电话促销”构成同义替换。John和Arthur做的工作是打电话促销，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Make phone calls to promote sales."},{"option":2,"content":"Arrange business negotiations."},{"option":3,"content":"Handle complaints from customers."},{"option":4,"content":"Take orders over the phone."}]},{"id":102237,"title":"What problem did John and Arthur have when they started job sharing?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n男士话中they didn’t like to wait until the next day to have their questions answered“他们不喜欢问题要等到第二天才能被解答”，与D选项questions could not be answered on the same day“问题不能当天被解答”构成同义替换，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They had different business strategies."},{"option":2,"content":"Customers often mistook one for the other."},{"option":3,"content":"Conflicts between them could not be properly solved."},{"option":4,"content":"Customers’ questions could not be answered on the same day."}]},{"id":102238,"title":"What does John say about their annual vacation?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n男士话中I take a week and Arthur takes a week“我休一周Arthur休一周”，与A选项each take a week“每人各休一周”构成同义替换。John说他俩的年假是两人各休一周，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They each take a week."},{"option":2,"content":"They like to spend it together."},{"option":3,"content":"They have to take it by turns."},{"option":4,"content":"They are given two weeks each."}]}]},{"id":4231,"name":"2012.12 (Conversation Two 卷二)","content":"W: May I see your license, please?\nM: But officer, did I do something wrong?\nW: Do you mean to say you didn’t see the speed limit sign back there?\nM: [23]Um, no, ma’am, I guess I didn’t.\nW: In other words, you drove by too fast to read it.
