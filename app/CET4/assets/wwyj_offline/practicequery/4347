We offer a wide range of options on the foundation course, [19] but you can only take five courses. What have you selected?\nW: Physical sciences, basic electronics, art and design CAD…\nM: Oh , right. CAD and English. That’s quite strange. Don’t you want to do maths, or computer programming, for example? Why did you choose art and design?\nW: [20]Well, I’m interested in electronics and in writing computer games. I’d like to produce educational software and educational games. I’ve taught myself a lot of programming. So I don’t think I’d benefit much from a foundation level course.\nM: Oh, no, I see that. Go on, please.\nW: So, I want the basics---the physical science and electronics. I was hopeless at physics in school and we didn’t have electronics. But I was good at maths. I don’t think I need that.\nM: Then what about the art and design?\nW: That will be good for my graphics---I need that to produce games, and CAD too---I’ve never done CAD before.\nM: Right. They’ve got some powerful packages in the computer graphics and CAD offices. You’ll enjoy that. Then English. I know your English is very good, but why did you take it?\nW: [21]In fact I don’t have any problem in speaking,  but my writing is terrible.\nM: Then I suggest you join the study skills class. They’ll have lectures on report writing and that may help you with how to structure your essays and so on.\nW: Right. That sounds good.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/20130603/2013-6(3)-C1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102257,"title":"What are the two speakers talking about?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词but后面courses … selected“课程…选择”，与B选项Which courses to choose “选哪门课”构成同义替换。两人谈论的话题是选哪门课，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"How to study English well."},{"option":2,"content":"Which courses to choose."},{"option":3,"content":"How to write computer games."},{"option":4,"content":"Which books to read."}]},{"id":102258,"title":"What is the woman’s favorite course?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n女士话中interested in electronics and in writing computer games“对电子学及编写电脑游戏感兴趣”，与D选项Electronics and computer-programming“电子学及电脑编程”构成同义替换。女士说她对电子学及编写电脑游戏感兴趣，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Physical sciences."},{"option":2,"content":"Maths and physics."},{"option":3,"content":"Art and design."},{"option":4,"content":"Electronics and computer-programming."}]},{"id":102259,"title":"Why did the woman take an English course?

I’m Diana Huston.\nM: Good morning. What can I do for you?\nW: [22]I’m a college student. I’m taking a business course which needs three weeks’ work experience. My lecturer, Mr. Armstrong, suggested I contact you as you’ve allowed students before to practice in your company. I’ve brought a letter of reference from Mr. Armstrong for you.\nM: Thanks. Yes, our company has a good relationship with the university. [23]We’ve had many students here over the past years. We usually take students who are in the second half of their courses. What about you?\nW: I’m almost at the halfway mark. I’ve got some exams in two weeks. Then I’ll be ready to start before the beginning of the second semester. But I thought I’d get this organized before the exams start.\nM: That’s a very responsible way of thinking. It’s a good idea to get in early. I’m sure there will be many students soon.\nW: I could start in three weeks if you like.\nM: Do you understand what’s involved in the practice?\nW: I think so. Mr. Armstrong explained the procedures to us. I have to work regular hours, and write a comprehensive report on what I’ve learnt as an assignment for Mr. Armstrong and the personnel department of the company as well. [24]And you will send a report about my work to Mr. Armstrong and that will also be part of my assessment.\nM: That’ right.
