He criticised teachers for failing to recognise that boys are actually more emotional than girls.\n    The research argued that boys often perform badly in mixed schools because they become discouraged when their female peers do better earlier in speaking and reading skills.\n    But in single-sex schools teachers can tailor lessons to boys' learning style, letting them move around the classroom and getting them to compete in teams to prevent boredom, wrote the study's author, Abigail James, of the University of Virginia.\n    Teachers could encourage boys to enjoy reading and writing with \"boy-focused\" approaches such as themes and characters that appeal to them. Because boys generally have more acute vision, learn best through touch, and are physically more active, they need to be given \"hands-on\" lessons where they are allowed to walk around. \"Boys in mixed schools view classical music as feminine (女性的) and prefer the modem genre (类型) in which violence and sexism are major themes,\" James wrote.\n    Single-sex education also made it less likely that boys would feel they had to conform to a stereotype that men should be \"masterful and in charge\" in relationships. \"In mixed schools, boys feel compelled to act like men before they understand themselves well enough to know what that means, \" the study reported.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102433,"title":"The author believes that a single-sex school would __________.","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的single-sex school将本题定位于第三段。\n解析：该段提到，单一性别的学校里的男孩to be more likely to get involved in cultural and artistic activities that helped develop their emotional expressiveness， “更有可能参加到文艺活动中，这有利于发展他们的情感表达”，由此可知单行学校能让男生更自由的表达他们的情感，故答案为B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"force boys to hide their emotions to be \"real men\""},{"option":2,"content":"encourage boys to express their emotions more freely"},{"option":3,"content":"help to cultivate masculine aggressiveness in boys"},{"option":4,"content":"naturally reinforce in boys the traditional image of a man"}]},{"id":102434,"title":"It is commonly believed that in a mixed school boys __________.","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的commonly believed和boys 将本题定位于第四段。\n解析：题干的commonly believed对应原文的received wisdom。本段指出了人们通常的看法是boys do better when taught alongside girls，也就是说男生在与女生一起学习的时候表现更好，故选D。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"behave more responsibly"},{"option":2,"content":"grow up more healthily"},{"option":3,"content":"receive a better education"},{"option":4,"content":"perform relatively better "}]},{"id":102435,"title":"What does Tony Little say about the British education system?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的Tony Little 和British education system将本题定位于第五段第一句。\n解析：该句提到，Tony Little认为it had become too focused on girls英国教育系统太关注女生了，即没有给男生足够的关注，故答案为C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It fails more boys than girls academically."},{"option":2,"content":"It focuses more on mixed school education."},{"option":3,"content":"It fails to give boys the attention they need."},{"option":4,"content":"It places more pressure on boys than on girls."}]},{"id":102436,"title":"According to Abigail James, one of the advantages of single-sex schools is __________.","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的 Abigail James和single-sex schools将本题定位于第七段。\n解析：该段提到，Abigail James认为在单性学校老师可以tailor lessons to boys' learning style，为男孩量身定制学习方式，故答案为B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"teaching can be designed to promote boys' team spirit"},{"option":2,"content":"teaching can be tailored to suit the characteristics of boys"},{"option":3,"content":"boys can choose to learn whatever they are interested in"},{"option":4,"content":"boys can focus on their lessons without being distracted"}]},{"id":102437,"title":"Which of the following is characteristic of boys according to Abigail James' report?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的 characteristic of boys和James'将本题定位于第八段第二句。\n解析：该处提到Abigail James认为男生一般眼光更敏锐，通过实际接触学习效果好，而且更好动，这些都是男孩子的特性。A选项中的have sharper vision对应原文中的 have more acute vision，故选择A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They have sharper vision."},{"option":2,"content":"They enjoy being in charge."},{"option":3,"content":"They are violent and sexist."},{"option":4,"content":"They conform to stereotypes."}]}]},{"id":4431,"name":"2011.12 Passage Two","content":"    It's an annual argument. Do we or do we not go on holiday? My partner says no because the boiler could go, or the roof fall off, and we have no savings to save us. I say you only live once and we work hard and what's the point if you can't go on holiday. The joy of a recession means no argument next year—we just won't go.\n    Since money is known to be one of the things most likely to bring a relationship to its knees, we should be grateful. For many families the recession means more than not booking a holiday.  A YouGov poll of 2, 000 people found 22% said they were arguing more with their partners because of concerns about money. What's less clear is whether divorce and separation rates rise in a recession—financial pressures mean couples argue more but make splitting up less affordable. A recent research shows arguments about money were especially damaging to couples. Disputes were characterised by intense verbal (言语上的) aggression, tended to be repeated and not resolved, and made men, more than women, extremely angry.\n    Kim Stephenson, an occupational psychologist, believes money is such a big deal because of what it symbolises, which may be different things to men and women. \"People can say the same things about money but have different ideas of what it's for,\" he explains. \"They'll say it's to save, to spend, for security, for freedom, to show someone you love them.\" He says men are more likely to see money as a way of buying status and of showing their parents that they've achieved something.\n    \"The biggest problem is that couples assume each other knows what's going on with their finances, but they don't. There seems to be more of a taboo (禁忌) about talking about money than talking about death. But you both need to know what you're doing, who's paying what into the joint account and how much you keep separately.
