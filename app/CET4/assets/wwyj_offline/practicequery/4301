While it may be common for university researchers to try their luck in the commercial world, there is very little traffic in the opposite direction. Pay has always been the biggest deterrent, as people with families often feel they cannot afford the drop in salary when moving to a university job. For some industrial scientists, however, the attractions of academia (学术界) outweigh any financial considerations.\n    Helen Lee took a 70% cut in salary when she moved from a senior post in Abbott Laboratories to a medical department at the University of Cambridge. Her main reason for returning to academia mid-career was to take advantage of the greater freedom to choose research questions. Some areas of inquiry have few prospects of a commercial return, and Lee’s is one of them.\n    The impact of a salary cut is probably less severe for a scientist in the early stages of a career. Guy Grant, now a research associate at the Unilever Centre for Molecular Informatics at the University of Cambridge, spent two years working for a pharmaceutical (制药的) company before returning to university as a post-doctoral researcher. He took a 30% salary cut but felt it worthwhile for the greater intellectual opportunities.\n    Higher up the ladder, where a pay cut is usually more significant, the demand for scientists with a wealth of experience in industry is forcing universities to make the transition (转换) to academia more attractive, according to Lee. Industrial scientists tend to receive training that academics do not, such as how to build a multidisciplinary team, manage budgets and negotiate contracts. They are also well placed to bring something extra to the teaching side of an academic role that will help students get a job when they graduate, says Lee, perhaps experience in manufacturing practice or product development, “Only a small number of undergraduates will continue in an academic career. So someone leaving university who already has the skills needed to work in an industrial lab has far more potential in the job market than someone who has spent all their time on a narrow research project.”","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102413,"title":"By “a one-way street” (Line 1, Para. 1), the author means ________.","textExplain":"定位：据题干中的a one-way street将本题定位于首段首句。\n解析：a one-way street意思为“单行道”。第二句While it may be common for university researchers to try their luck in the commercial world, there is very little traffic in the opposite direction，“尽管大学研究人员去工商业界碰运气很普遍，但是反面的情况却很少”，也就是说产业科学家转行从事科研不常见，故此题答案选B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"university researchers know little about the commercial world"},{"option":2,"content":"few industrial scientists would quit to work in a university"},{"option":3,"content":"few university professors are willing to do industrial research"},{"option":4,"content":"there is little exchange between industry and academia"}]},{"id":102414,"title":"The word “deterrent” (Line 3, Para. 1) most probably refers to something that ________.","textExplain":"定位：据题干中的deterrent将本题定位于第一段第三句。\n解析：其前半句指出，收入一直以来都是最大的deterrent，而后半句解释其原因as people with families often feel they cannot afford the drop in salary when moving to a university job，有家室的人都无法接受工资上的落差。由此可推断deterrent困难、障碍的意思，即“组织某人采取行动的东西”，故答案选C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"brings someone a financial burden"},{"option":2,"content":"helps to move the traffic  "},{"option":3,"content":"keeps someone from taking action "},{"option":4,"content":"attracts people’s attention "}]},{"id":102415,"title":"What was Helen Lee’s major consideration when she changed her job in the middle of her career?","textExplain":"定位：据题干中的Helen lee和middle f her career将本题定位于第二段第二句。\n解析： Helen lee在事业发展中期换工作的原因是take advantage of the greater freedom to choose research questions，“利用那里更大的自由权来选择研究专题”。也就是说，她换工作主要是考虑到个人的研究兴趣，故选A。 ","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Her research interests."},{"option":2,"content":"Flexible work hours."},{"option":3,"content":"Prospects of academic accomplishments."},{"option":4,"content":"Her preference for the lifestyle on campus."}]},{"id":102416,"title":"Guy Grant chose to work as a researcher at Cambridge in order to ________.","textExplain":"定位：据题干中Guy Grant和a researcher at Cambridge将本题定位于第三段第二、三句。\n解析：第三段第二句提到，Guy Grant在制药公司干了两年之后到剑桥大学当助理研究员，第三句接着提到他的收入减少了30%，但是，他感觉为了有更好的机会发展自己的才智，这些损失是值得的。原句中的intellectual opportunities直接出现于C中，而且exploit和for，better和greater在意义上一一对应，由此确定答案选C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"do financially more rewarding work"},{"option":2,"content":"raise his status in the academic world"},{"option":3,"content":"exploit better intellectual opportunities"},{"option":4,"content":"enrich his experience in medical research"}]},{"id":102417,"title":"What contribution can industrial scientists make when they come to teach in a university?","textExplain":"定位：据题干中的industrial scientists和 teach将本题定位于最后一段第三句。\n解析：该句中，They are also well placed to bring something extra to the teaching side of an academic role that will help students get a job when they graduate，意思是产业科学家们到大学教学能够给学生们带来一些产业实验室里的工作技能，这些技能可以增强学生在就业市场上的竞争力，故答案选A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Increase its graduates’ competitiveness in the job market."},{"option":2,"content":"Help it to obtain financial support from industry."},{"option":3,"content":"Gear its research towards practical applications."},{"option":4,"content":"Develop its students’ potential in research."}]}]},{"id":4411,"name":"2010.12 Passage Two","content":"    Being sociable looks like a good way to add years to your life. Relationships with family, friends, neighbours, even pets, will all do the trick, but the biggest longevity (长寿) boost seems to come from marriage or an equivalent relationship. The effect was first noted in 1858 by William Farr, who wrote that widows and widowers (鳏夫) were at a much higher risk of dying than their married peers. Studies since then suggest that marriage could add as much as seven years to a man’s life and two to a woman’s. The effect holds for all causes of death, whether illness, accident or self-harm.\n    Even if the odds are stacked against you, marriage can more than compensate. Linda Waite of the University of Chicago has found that a married older man with heart disease can expect to live nearly four years longer than an unmarried man with a healthy heart. Likewise, a married man who smokes more than a pack a day is likely to live as long as a divorced man who doesn’t smoke. There’s a flip side, however, as partners are more likely to become ill or die in the couple of years following their spouse’s death, and caring for a spouse with mental disorder can leave you with some of the same severe problems. Even so, the odds favour marriage. In a 30-year study of more than 10,000 people, Nicholas Christakis of Harvard Medical School describes how all kinds of social networks have similar effects.\n    So how does it work? The effects are complex, affected by socio-economic factors, health-service provision, emotional support and other more physiological (生理的) mechanisms. For example, social contact can boost development of the brain and immune system, leading to better health and less chance of depression later in life. People in supportive relationships may handle stress better. Then there are the psychological benefits of a supportive partner.\n    A life partner, children and good friends are all recommended if you aim to live to 100. The ultimate social network is still being mapped out, but as Christakis says: “People are interconnected, so their health is interconnected.”","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102418,"title":"William Farr’s study and other studies show that _________.","textExplain":"定位：据题干中的William Farr和studies将本题定位于首段三句。\n解析：第三句是对第二句的详细解释，第二句中but the biggest longevity boost seems to come from marriage or an equivalent relationship，“最能促进长寿的是婚姻或类似伴侣关系”，所以选择B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"social life provides an effective cure for illness"},{"option":2,"content":"marriage contributes a great deal to longevity"},{"option":3,"content":"women benefit more than men from marriage"},{"option":4,"content":"being sociable helps improve one’s quality of life"}]},{"id":102419,"title":"Linda Waite’s studies support the idea that _________.","textExplain":"定位：据题干中的Linda Waite将本题定位于第二段第二句。\n解析：该句提到Linda Waite的研究发现，a married older man with heart disease can expect to live nearly four years longer than an unmarried man with a healthy heart，“一位患有心脏病的已婚老人会比同样会有此病的未婚老人多活将近四年”。该段第一句话说，即使一切情况都对你不利，婚姻也能够起到很大的弥补作用，不难得出答案为C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"the married are happier than the unmarried"},{"option":2,"content":"older men should quit smoking to stay healthy"},{"option":3,"content":"marriage can help make up for ill health"},{"option":4,"content":"unmarried people are likely to suffer in later life"}]},{"id":102420,"title":"It can be inferred from the context that the “flip side” (Line 5, Para. 2) refers to _________.","textExplain":"定位：据题干中的flip side将本题定位于第二段第四句。\n解析：该句中partners are more likely to become ill or die in the couple of years following their spouse’s death, and caring for a spouse with mental disorder can leave you with some of the same severe problems，“在配偶过世的几年里，另一半更有可能病倒或死亡，照顾患有心理障碍的配偶也会导致你患有同样严重的疾病”，可知婚姻也有不利的地方，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"the consequence of a broken marriage"},{"option":2,"content":"the emotional problems arising from marriage"},{"option":3,"content":"the responsibility of taking care of one’s family"},{"option":4,"content":"the disadvantages of being married"}]},{"id":102421,"title":"What does the author say about social networks?","textExplain":"定位：据题干中的social networks将本题定位于第二段末句。\n解析：该句提到social networks have similar effects，“社交网络与婚姻关系有相似的效果”，故答案选D。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They help develop people’s community spirit."},{"option":2,"content":"They provide timely support for those in need."},{"option":3,"content":"They help relieve people of their life’s burdens."},{"option":4,"content":"They have effects similar to those of a marriage."}]},{"id":102422,"title":"What can be inferred from the last paragraph?","textExplain":"定位：根据题干可定位到最后一段。\n解析：该段第一句提到，如果你希望长命百岁，拥有终生伴侣、孩子、好朋友都是值得推荐的。其中的“终身伴侣、子女和好朋友” 都是社交网络的组成部分，而A中的To stay healthy也是对live to 100的同义转述，故确定答案为A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"To stay healthy, one should have a proper social network."},{"option":2,"content":"Getting a divorce means risking a reduced life span."},{"option":3,"content":"We should share our social networks with each other."},{"option":4,"content":"It’s important that we develop a social network when young."}]}]}]}
