I’ve been a patron(老主顾)all the life, and for the past nine years I’ve worked at multiple libraries and archives in and around Detroit. The library as an institution has many roles, but as our country struggles through an economic crisis, I have watched the library where I work evolve into a career and business center, a community gathering place and a bastion(堡垒)of hope. \n    In the spring of 2007 I got a library internship(实习生的位置) at the Southfield Public Library (SPL), just north of Detroit. Summers at SPL were usually slow, but that year, we experienced a library that was as busy as science-fair project week, midterms or tax season. Yet patrons weren’t looking for Mosby’s Nursing Drug Reference or tax return forms. They were coming for information on growing their small business.\n    I interpreted people’s interest in our business collection as the first step to pursuing their dreams, but these patrons were not motivated by dreams. They were responding to reality, and they were looking for Plan B.\n    Things worsened in 2008, and in 2009 the economic crisis continues to plague Michigan. Last year, we put up a display with a variety of job resources that we restocked every hour. Each night the library closed, the display was bare. While we normally keep displays up for a week, we kept the job resources display up for months.\n    Then there’s the tightening credit market. People see the writing on the wall and they want to get educated. They can’t afford a financial adviser, but checking books out is free. Some of the most popular titles now are Rich Dad, Poor Dad, Think and Grow Rich, and Suze Orman’s 2009 Action Plan.\n    The economic downturn affects us all. I have had to work long hours and don’t get to see much of my boyfriend or experience any kind of social life lately, but I am thankful to be in a position where I can help people overcome this struggle. In Michigan, we haven’t lost hope. As long as there are libraries here, there will always be hope.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102483,"title":"What changes has the current economic crisis brought to the library?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的economic crisis 定位到文章第一段第二句。\n解析：答案在定位句后面一句，I have watched the library where I work evolve into a career and business center, a community gathering place and a bastion(堡垒)of hope，“我目睹了图书馆演变成了一个职业和商业中心、一个社区集会场所、一座希望的堡垒”，故答案为B。 ","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It has opened its age-old archives to the general public."},{"option":2,"content":"It has become a job and business information center."},{"option":3,"content":"It has evolved into a place for business transactions."},{"option":4,"content":"It has had to cut its budget to get through the crisis."}]},{"id":102484,"title":"What does the author say about the Southfield Public Library in the summer of 2007?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的Southfield Public Library和summer of 2007定位到文章第二段第一、二句。\n解析：文章第二段第二句提到，we experienced a library that was as busy as science-fair project week, midterms or tax season，我们经历了如同科技展览项目周、期中考试周或者报税季那样繁忙的夏季。由此可知，2007年夏的南菲尔德公立图书馆挤满了读者，故答案为A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It was overflowing with visitors."},{"option":2,"content":"It launched a science project series."},{"option":3,"content":"It added many books on business to its collection."},{"option":4,"content":"It was full of people seeking information on drugs."}]},{"id":102485,"title":"What can be inferred from people’s strong interest in the library’s business collection?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的interest和business collection定位到文章第三段。\n解析：文章第三段指出，大家对商业藏书产生浓厚兴趣，作者的理解是这是他们追求梦想的第一步，但是梦想却不是他们的动力。他们这样做只是对现实的回应，他们寻找备用计划。现实就是：经济萎靡，他们担心随时都可能丢饭碗，因此需要读一些与工作和商业相关的书籍，以备不时之需，故答案为D。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They think it is now time to realize their dreams."},{"option":2,"content":"They find economics helpful in tiding over the crisis."},{"option":3,"content":"They consider it a trend to start their own business."},{"option":4,"content":"They are concerned about the worsening economy."}]},{"id":102486,"title":"Why were there no more job resources on display by the end of the day?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的job resources和the end of the day定位到文章第四段最后一句话。\n解析：第四段最后一句与题干重复。第五段二三句说，人们想要接受教育，但是负担不起金融顾问，而从图书馆借些书是免费的。也就是说，他们对工作资源方面的陈列书籍感兴趣，所以这方面的书籍会被全部借走，故答案为C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The library staff could not do the restocking quickly enough."},{"option":2,"content":"People competed with each other for the jobs listed in the ads."},{"option":3,"content":"People were much interested in the job resources on display."},{"option":4,"content":"All the materials on display were free of charge to the jobless."}]},{"id":102487,"title":"How did the author feel about working in the library?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的fell 和working in the library定位到文章最后一段第二句。\n解析：文章最后一段第二句指出，能够在这个岗位上帮助人们度过难关时刻，“我”心存感激。作者在文章中使用的是thankful“感激的”，与A）中的contented“满足的”属于同义转换，故答案为A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"She felt contented to be in a position to render help."},{"option":2,"content":"She felt pleased to be able to give hope to the jobless."},{"option":3,"content":"She felt rewarded to have gained a lot of experience."},{"option":4,"content":"She felt sorry to miss the social life she used to enjoy."}]}]},{"id":4481,"name":"2013.6 (Passage Two 卷二)","content":"    More than three dozen billionaires, including well-known philanthropist(慈善家) David Rockefeller, have promised at least half of their fortunes to charity, joining a programme that Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett started in June to encourage other wealthy people to give.\n    The pledge is currently worth about $150 billion, but the programme predicts it will eventually be worth $600 billion.\n    “During even the Depression’s worst years, my parents gave money—about 8% of their annual income of $2,200,” said Lorry Lokey, one of the donors, on the website of the programme, the Giving Pledge, “I remember saying to my mother that we can’t afford that. But she said we have to share with others.”\n    The pledge has been a matter of some debate in philanthropic and non-profit circles, with some experts dismissing it as mere publicity and others predicting that it would produce a flood of new money to support non-profit groups.\n    Buffett said the real value of the pledge was found in the example it set and in the sentiments(情感) expressed in the letters posted on the website.\n    Buffett and Gate will hold several dinners later this year to recruit more billionaires, and members of the Giving Pledge will meet annually to discuss their philanthropy.\n    The pair are due to meet some wealthiest people in China next month and India in March.\n    “We hope this catches fire in some other countries,” Buffett said. “If they want to take what we think is a good idea and run with it, we will be cheering.”\n    Buffett said the number of people who had agreed to sign on was at the high end of his expectations. He said some people who declined to sign the pledge were planning to give away most of their wealth but did not want to draw attention to those plans.\n    Energy tycoon(大亨) Pickens, who is worth about $1 billion, said in his Giving Pledge letter: “I’ve long stated that I enjoy making money, and I enjoy giving it away. I’m not a big fan of inherited wealth.
