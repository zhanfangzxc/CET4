They offer great entertainment. One popular event is the pie-eating contest. If you want to take part in the contest, it is a good idea to remember these guidelines: [30] first, make sure your stomach is nearly empty of food. Eating a whole pie can be hard if you have just finished a meal. Next, it is helpful to like the pie you are going to eat. The cream types are a good choice. They slide down the throat more easily. Placing your hands in the right position adds to the chances of winning. There is a temptation to reach out and help the eating process. This will result in becoming disqualified.

Two people agree to marry when they decide to spend their lives together. The man usually gives the woman a diamond engagement ring. That tradition is said to have started when an Austrian man gave a diamond ring to the woman he wanted to marry. [33]The diamond represented beauty. He placed it on the third finger of her left hand. [34]He chose that finger because it was thought that the blood vessel in that finger went directly to the heart. Today we know that this is not true, yet the tradition continues.\n    Americans generally are engaged for a period of about one year if they are planning a wedding ceremony and a party. During this time, friends of the bride may hold a party at which women friends and family members give the bride gifts that she will need as a wife. These could include cooking equipment or new clothing. Friends of the man who is getting married may have a bachelor party for him. This usually takes place the night before the wedding. Only men are invited to the bachelor party.\n    During the marriage ceremony, the bride and her would-be husband usually exchange gold rings that represent the idea that their union will continue forever. The wife often wears both the wedding ring and the engagement ring on the same finger. The husband wears his ring on the third finger of his left hand. Many people say the purpose of the engagement period is to permit enough time to plan the wedding. [35] But the main purpose is to let enough time pass so the two people are sure that they want to marry each other. Either person may decide to break the engagement, if this happens, the woman usually returns the ring to the man. They also return any wedding gifts they have received.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/20130603/2013-6(3)-P3.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102380,"title":"What was the diamond ring said to represent?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n原文中beauty“美丽”，与A选项构成视听一致。钻戒代表着美丽，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Beauty."},{"option":2,"content":"Loyalty."},{"option":3,"content":"Luck."},{"option":4,"content":"Durability."}]},{"id":102381,"title":"Why did the Austrian man place the diamond ring on the third finger of the left hand of his would-be wife?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词because后面it was thought that the blood vessel in that finger went directly to the heart“人们认为左手中指的血管直通心脏”，与C选项构成视听一致。丈夫将钻戒戴在未婚妻的左手中指是因为人们认为左手中指的血管直通心脏，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He wanted to follow the tradition of his country."},{"option":2,"content":"He believed that it symbolized an everlasting marriage."},{"option":3,"content":"It was thought a blood vessel in that finger led directly to the heart."},{"option":4,"content":"It was supposed that the diamond on that finger would bring good luck."}]},{"id":102382,"title":"What is the chief advantage of having the engagement period?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词But后面let enough time pass so the two people are sure that they want to marry each other“用充足的时间去确定是否真的想结婚”，与B选项have time to decide if they are a good match“有充足的时间来考察对方是否是理想的结婚对象”构成同义替换，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The two people can learn about each other’s likes and dislikes."},{"option":2,"content":"The two people can have time to decide if they are a good match."},{"option":3,"content":"The two people can have time to shop for their new home."},{"option":4,"content":"The two people can earn enough money for their wedding."}]}]}]}
