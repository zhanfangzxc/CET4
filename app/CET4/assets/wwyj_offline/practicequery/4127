The study's authors, Joanne Wood and John Lee of the University of Waterloo and Elaine Perunovic of the University of New Brunswick, begin by citing older research showing that when people get feedback which they believe is overly positive, they actually feel worse, not better. If you tell your dim friend that he has the potential of an Einstein, you're just underlining his faults. In one 1990s experiment, a team including psychologist Joel Cooper of Princeton asked participants to write essays opposing funding for the disabled.

Even if the odds are stacked against you, marriage can more than compensate. Linda Waite of the University of Chicago has found that a married older man with heart disease can expect to live nearly four years longer than an unmarried man with a healthy heart. Likewise, a married man who smokes more than a pack a day is likely to live as long as a divorced man who doesn’t smoke. There’s a flip side, however, as partners are more likely to become ill or die in the couple of years following their spouse’s death, and caring for a spouse with mental disorder can leave you with some of the same severe problems. Even so, the odds favour marriage. In a 30-year study of more than 10,000 people, Nicholas Christakis of Harvard Medical School describes how all kinds of social networks have similar effects.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":21,"title":"It can be inferred from the context that the “flip side” (Line 5, Para. 2) refers to _________.","textExplain":"定位：据题干中的flip side将本题定位于第二段第四句。\n解析：该句中partners are more likely to become ill or die in the couple of years following their spouse’s death, and caring for a spouse with mental disorder can leave you with some of the same severe problems，“在配偶过世的几年里，另一半更有可能病倒或死亡，照顾患有心理障碍的配偶也会导致你患有同样严重的疾病”，可知婚姻也有不利的地方，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/cet4/CET4_reading_video/3_gejiqiao/025_ciyilianxi4.mp4","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"the consequence of a broken marriage"},{"option":2,"content":"the emotional problems arising from marriage"},{"option":3,"content":"the responsibility of taking care of one’s family"},{"option":4,"content":"the disadvantages of being married"}]}]}]}
