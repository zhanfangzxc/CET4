So what shall we work on today?\nM: Well, the problem is that this writing assignment isn’t coming out right. [19]What I thought I was writing on was to talk about what a particular sport means to me when I participate in.\nW: What sport did you choose?\nM: I decided to write about cross-country skiing.\nW: What are you going to say about skiing?\nM: That’s the problem. I thought I would write about how peaceful it is to be out in the country.\nW: So why is that a problem?\nM: As I start describing how quiet it is to be out in the woods, I keep mentioning how much effort it takes to keep going. Cross-country skiing isn’t as easy as some people think. It takes a lot of energy, but that’s not part of my paper. So I guess I should leave it out. [20] But now I don’t know how to explain that feeling of peacefulness without explaining how hard you have to work for it.  It all fits together. It’s not like just sitting down somewhere and watching the clouds roll by. That’s different.\nW: Then you’ll have to include that in your point. The peacefulness of cross-country skiing is the kind you earn by effort. Why leave that out? [21]Part of your point you knew beforehand but part you discovered as you wrote. That’s common, right?\nM: Yeah, I guess so.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/201106/2011-6-C1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102208,"title":"What is the topic of the man’s writing assignment?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词particular后面sport … participate in“参加的活动”，与D选项构成视听一致。男士写作的话题是参加过的活动，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Beautiful scenery in the countryside."},{"option":2,"content":"Dangers of cross-country skiing."},{"option":3,"content":"Pain and pleasure in sports."},{"option":4,"content":"A sport he participates in."}]},{"id":102209,"title":"What problem does the man have while working on his paper?

Tonight we have Mr. Angeleno who came to the United States six years ago, and is now an established businessman with three restaurants in town. Tell us Mr. Angeleno, how did you get started?\nM: Well, I started off with a small diner. [23] I did all the cooking myself and my wife waited on tables. It was really too much work for two people. My cooking is great. And word got around town about the food. Within a year, I had to hire another cook and four waitresses. When that restaurant became very busy, I decided to expand my business. Now with three places my main concern is keeping the business successful and running smoothly.\nW: Do you advertise?\nM: Oh yes. I don't have any TV commercials, because they are too expensive. [24] But I advertise a lot on radio and in local newspapers. My children used to distribute ads in nearby shopping centers, but we don't need to do that anymore.\nW: Why do you believe you've been so successful?\nM: [25]Um, I always serve the freshest possible food and I make the atmosphere as comfortable and as pleasant as I can, so that my customers will want to come back.\nW: So you always aim to please the customers?\nM: Absolutely! Without them, I would have no business at all.\nW: Thank you Mr. Angeleno.
