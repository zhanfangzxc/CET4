That’s why you’ll normally find the central goods like bread, vegetables and meat in completely different parts of the store. [27]Products with a high profit margin are always placed on shelves within easy reach of the customer, while lower margin items like sugar or flower are on the top or bottom shelves. Many people make shopping list before they visit supermarkets. [28] But even so, around 60% of all supermarket purchases are the result of decisions that are taken in the store. For this reason, supermarkets try to attract their customers by placing certain kinds of product next to each other. In the UK, beer will often be found next to items for babies because research shows that fathers of babies buy them on their way home from work and will buy beer at the same time. Research has also shown that this kind of impulse buy happens more frequently when no sales assistants are nearby. Supermarkets have made selling such a fine art that their customers [29] often lose all sense of time. When interviewed, customers normally guess they’ve only spent half an hour in the supermarket even when they have been there for over 45 minutes. But that shouldn’t be too surprising. Any really profitable supermarket knows that is should keep its clocks well hidden.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/20130602/2013-6(2)-P1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102363,"title":"Why are central goods displayed in totally different parts of the supermarket?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n文章开头处see as many of them as possible“看到尽可能多的商品”，与B选项构成视听一致。超市希望顾客看到的商品越多越好，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"To give customers a wider range of choices."},{"option":2,"content":"To make shoppers see as many items as possible."},{"option":3,"content":"To supply as many varieties of goods as it can."},{"option":4,"content":"To save space for more profitable products."}]},{"id":102364,"title":"Where are goods with a high profit margin usually found?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词always后面on shelves within easy reach“在容易接触到的货架上”，与C选项On easily accessible shelves构成同义替换。利润高的商品所放置的位置都是顾客们最容易够得到的地方，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"On the top shelves."},{"option":2,"content":"On the bottom shelves."},{"option":3,"content":"On easily accessible shelves."},{"option":4,"content":"On clearly marked shelves."}]},{"id":102365,"title":"What does the speaker say about supermarket goers?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词But后面decisions that are taken in the store“在超市里下的决定”，与A选项buy things on impulse构成同义替换。Speaker说大部分去超市购物的人都有冲动购物的行为，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Many of them buy things on impulse."},{"option":2,"content":"A few of them are fathers with babies."},{"option":3,"content":"A majority of them are young couples."},{"option":4,"content":"Over 60% of them make shopping lists."}]},{"id":102366,"title":"What shouldn’t be too surprising according to the speaker?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词often后面lose all sense of time“在超市中没了时间感”，与D选项构成视听一致。顾客在超市中没有了时间感，而这一现象并不奇怪，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Sales assistants promoting high margin goods."},{"option":2,"content":"Sales assistants following customers around."},{"option":3,"content":"Customers competing for good bargains."},{"option":4,"content":"Customers losing all sense of time."}]}]},{"id":4358,"name":"2013.6 (Passage Two 卷二)","content":"    [30]When Matty Sallin was working on a degree in art and technology at university, he got an interesting assignment in electronics class: Create something for the household. He decided to create an alarm clock. “Everybody has to use an alarm clock of some kind every day, and it’s extremely unpleasant!” he says. [31] He asked different people what they’d like to wake up to instead of a noisy alarm. A lot of them said, “The smell of bacon.” So Sallin invented a new kind of alarm clock: a wooden box with a pig face and a digital clock that uses [32] the smell of cooking bacon rather than sound to wake someone up. He explains, “There’s no danger of burning, because I built it carefully. It uses light bulbs instead of a flame for cooking and turns off automatically after ten minutes.” Just a few easy steps are required to set the “alarm.” “What you do is put in a couple of frozen strips the night before,” says Sallin. Bacon is preserved, so there is no danger of its spoiling overnight. “If you set the alarm for 8:00, it will turn on at 7:50 and slow cook for ten minutes under the bulbs,” he says. Then the bulbs turn off and a fan blows the smell out through the nose of the pig. “So instead of an alarm, you smell yourself awake,” says Sallin. “Then you can open the door on the side and pull the bacon out and eat it.”","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/20130602/2013-6(2)-P2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102367,"title":"What was Matty Sallin doing when he created an alarm clock?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n文章开头处working on a degree in art and technology at university“在大学读艺术和技术这一专业”，与C选项Studying for a college degree“学习大学学位”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Teaching mathematics at a school."},{"option":2,"content":"Doing research in an institute."},{"option":3,"content":"Studying for a college degree."},{"option":4,"content":"Working in a hi-tech company."}]},{"id":102368,"title":"What did Matty Sallin do before making the new type of alarm clock?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n原文中He asked different people“他征求了其他人的想法”，与D选项“让”构成视听一致。在Matty Sallin设计一款新的闹钟之前，他先征求其他人的想法，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He studied the designs of various clocks."},{"option":2,"content":"He did experiments on different materials."},{"option":3,"content":"He bought an alarm clock with a pig face."},{"option":4,"content":"He asked different people for their opinions.

For some people, though, loneliness can last for years. Psychologists are studying this complex phenomenon and have identified three different types of loneliness.\n    The first kind of loneliness is temporary. It usually disappears quickly and does not require any special attention. [33]The second kind, situational loneliness, is a natural result of a particular situation, for example, a divorce or moving to a new place. Although this kind of loneliness can cause physical problems it usually does not last for more than a year. Unlike the second type, the third kind of loneliness usually lasts more than two years and has no specific cause. [34]People who experience habitual loneliness have problems socializing and becoming close to others. Unfortunately, many of them think there is little or nothing they can do about it.\n    Psychologists agree that one important factor in loneliness is a person’s social contacts, for example, friends, family members, etc. We depend on various people for different reasons. For instance, our families give us emotional support and our friends share similar interests and activities. However, psychologists have found that the number of social contacts we have is not the only reason for loneliness. It is more important how many social contacts we think or expect we should have. In other words, though lonely people may have many social contacts, they sometimes feel they should have more. [35] They question their own popularity.
