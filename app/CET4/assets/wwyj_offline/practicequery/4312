Were they turned off because an American had the nerve to instruct Japanese in their own art form or they deliberately tried to signal their rejection of her? Obcamp later found out that her listeners were not being disrespectful. [27]Japanese listeners sometimes closed their eyes to enhance concentration. Her listeners were showing their respect for her by chewing on her words. Some day you may be either a speaker or a listener in a situation involving people from other countries or members of minority group in North America. [28]Learning how different cultures signal respect can help you avoid misunderstandings. Here are some examples. In the deaf culture of North America, many listeners show applause not by clapping their hands but by waving them in the air. In some cultures, both overseas and in some minority groups in North America, listeners are considered disrespectful if they look directly at the speaker. Respect is shown by looking in the general direction but avoiding direct eye contact. In some countries, whistling by listeners is a sign of approval while in other countries it is a form of insult.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/201112/2011-12-P1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102314,"title":"What did Obcamp’s speech focus on?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n文章开头处the art of Japanese brush painting“日本的毛笔画艺术”，与A选项构成视听一致。美国艺术家Obcamp做了一个关于日本的毛笔画艺术的演讲，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The art of Japanese brush painting."},{"option":2,"content":"Some features of Japanese culture."},{"option":3,"content":"Characteristics of Japanese artists."},{"option":4,"content":"The uniqueness of Japanese art."}]},{"id":102315,"title":"Why do Japanese listeners sometimes close their eyes while listening to a speech?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词sometimes后面enhance concentration“提高注意力”，与A选项构成视听一致。有些日本观众闭上眼睛是为了提高注意力，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"To enhance concentration."},{"option":2,"content":"To calm themselves down."},{"option":3,"content":"To show their impatience."},{"option":4,"content":"To signal lack of interest."}]},{"id":102316,"title":"What does the speaker try to explain?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n原文中how different cultures signal respect“在不同的文化中如何表达尊重”，与D选项How listeners in different cultures show respect“来自不同文化的听众如何表示尊重”构成同义替换。Gail Obcamp演讲中的故事是为了说明了解不同的文化中如何表达尊重会帮你避免误解，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"How speakers can misunderstand the audience."},{"option":2,"content":"How speakers can win approval from the audience."},{"option":3,"content":"How different Western and Eastern art forms are."},{"option":4,"content":"How listeners in different cultures show respect."}]}]},{"id":4309,"name":"2011.12 Passage Two","content":"    [29]Chris is in charge of purchasing and maintaining equipment in his division at Tax Along Company. He is soon going to have an evaluation interview with his supervisor and the personnel director to discuss the work he has done in the past year. Salary, promotion and plans for the coming year will also be discussed at the meeting. Chris has made several changes for his division in the past year. First, he bought new equipment for one of the departments. He has been particularly happy about the new equipment because many of the employees have told him how much it has helped them. Along with improving the equipment, Chris began a program to train employees to use equipment better and do simple maintenance themselves. The training saved time for the employees and money for the company. Unfortunately, one serious problem developed during the year. [30]Two employees that Chris hired were stealing, and he had to fire them. Chris knows that a new job for a purchasing and maintenance manager for the whole company will be open in a few months, and he would like to [31] be promoted to the job.

They are little lessons which older people of a culture pass down to the younger people to teach them about life. [33]Many proverbs remind people of the values that are important in the culture. Values teach people how to act, what is right, and what is wrong. Because the values of each culture are different, understanding the values of another culture helps explain how people think and act. Understanding your own cultural values is important too. If you can accept that people from other cultures act according to their values, not yours, getting along with them will be much easier. Many proverbs are very old. [34] So some of the values they teach may not be as important in the culture as they once were.  For example, Americans today do not pay much attention to the proverb “Haste makes waste”, because patience is not important to them. But if you know about past values, it helps you to understand the present. And many of the older values are still strong today. Benjamin Franklin, a famous American diplomat, writer and scientist, died in 1790, but his proverb “Time is money” is taken more seriously by Americans of today than ever before. [35]A study of proverbs from around the world shows that some values are shared by many cultures.  In many cases though, the same idea is expressed differently.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/201112/2011-12-P3.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102321,"title":"Why are proverbs so important?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词Many后面values that are important in the culture“文化中重要的价值观”，与A选项important values of culture构成视听一致。谚语的重要性体现在它们让人们看到了文化中重要的价值观，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They help us see the important values of a culture."},{"option":2,"content":"They guide us in handling human relationships."},{"option":3,"content":"They help us express ourselves more effectively."},{"option":4,"content":"They are an infinite source of human knowledge."}]},{"id":102322,"title":"According to the speaker, what happens to some proverbs with the passage of time?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词so后面values … may not be as important in the culture as they once were“有些价值观也许不如当初那么重要了”，与C选项The values they reflect may change“谚语反映出的价值观有可能会改变”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Their origins can no longer be traced."},{"option":2,"content":"Their wording may become different."},{"option":3,"content":"The values they reflect may change."},{"option":4,"content":"They may be misinterpreted occasionally."}]},{"id":102323,"title":"What do we learn from the study of proverbs from around the world?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n文章结尾处some values are shared by many cultures“有些价值观被许多文化所共享”，与A选项Certain values are shared by a large number of cultures构成同义替换。短文结尾部分提到，通过研究调查世界各地的谚语，人们发现不同的文化中有着相同的价值观，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Certain values are shared by a large number of cultures."},{"option":2,"content":"Some proverbs are assuming more and more importance."},{"option":3,"content":"Old proverbs are constantly replaced by new ones."},{"option":4,"content":"Certain values have always been central to a culture."}]}]}]}
