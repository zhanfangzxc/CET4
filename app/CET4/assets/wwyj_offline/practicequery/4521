[17]She joined the Peace Corps after she graduated from college because she wanted to do something to help other people.She had been brought up on a farm, so the Peace Corps assigned her to an agricultural project.Before she went to Brazil, she studied Portuguese for three months. She also learned a great deal about its history and culture. During her two years with the Peace Corps, Donna lived in a village in northeastern Brazil. That part of Brazil is very dry and farming is often difficult there. Donna helped the people of the village to organise an irrigation project, and she also advised them on planting corps that didn't require much water. When Donna returned to the States, she couldn't settle down. [18]She tried several jobs, but they seemed very boring to her. She couldn't get Brazil out of her mind. Finally, one day she got on a plane and went back to Brazil. She wasn't sure what she was going to do. She just wanted to be there. After a few weeks, Donna found a job as an English teacher, teaching five classes a day. [19]Like most of the teachers, she doesn't make much money.She shares a small apartment with another teacher.

With the time spent eating, sleeping and taking care of household duties, there's little time left for leisure activities for many Americans. However, having free time to relax and pursue hobbies is important. People need time away from the pressures of study or work to relax and enjoy time with friends and family. [21]In different countries, free time is spent in different ways. The results of the Harry's poll showed that reading was the most popular spare time activity in the US. This was followed by watching TV. In a UK survey on leisure time activities, watching TV and videos was most popular. Listening to the radio came second. In a similar survey conducted in Japan, the most popular free time activity was eating out. The second most popular activity was driving. There were also differences in the most popular outdoor pursuits between the three countries. [22]The most popular outdoor activity for Americans was gardening. In the UK, it was going to the pub. In Japan, going to bars ranked eighth in popularity and gardening ranked ninth. Although people around the world may enjoy doing similar things in their free time, there's evidence to suggest that these interests are changing. In the US, for example, the popularity of computer activities is increasing. Many more people in the States are spending their free time surfing the Web, emailing friends or playing games online.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/20131201/2013-12(1)-P2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":103200,"title":"What is the recent Harry’s poll mainly about?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词However后面，having free time to relax and pursue hobbies is important，“有自由时间去放松和追求业余爱好是很重要的”，与C选项中的Time spent on leisure activities构成视同义替换。Harry的民意调查主要是关于花在业余活动上的时间的，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Time spent exercising."},{"option":2,"content":"Time spent working."},{"option":3,"content":"Time spent on leisure activities."},{"option":4,"content":"Time spent with friends and family."}]},{"id":103201,"title":"What was the most popular leisure activity in the US?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词most处reading was the most popular spare time activity in the US，“阅读是美国最流行的休闲活动”，其中reading，与A选项构成视听一致，故A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Reading."},{"option":2,"content":"Surfing the Web."},{"option":3,"content":"Eating out."},{"option":4,"content":"Watching TV."}]},{"id":103202,"title":"What was the most popular outdoor pursuit in the UK?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n原文中In the UK, it was going to the pub，“在英国，（最受欢迎的户外运动）是去酒吧”，其中going to the pub，与C选项构成视听一致。短文最后提到美、英、日三国做流行的户外活动，美国人最爱园艺而英国人最爱去酒吧，日本人对这两项都不很喜欢，所以C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Driving."},{"option":2,"content":"Gardening."},{"option":3,"content":"Going to the pub."},{"option":4,"content":"Visiting friends.

The accident occurred in Riverside California. [23]Not paying attention to his driving, McLaughlin turned right on main street in 33rd street and hit a Volkswagen Rabbit. This caused minor damage to his truck and serious damage to the car. On the basis of the police report, the Lummis Accident Committee correctly determined that McLaughlin had been quite careless. As a result of the committee's conclusion, the branch manager Mr David Rossi reported that he had talked with McLaughlin about his extremely poor driving record. Further evidence of McLaughlin's irresponsibility occurred on May 6 when he was returning from his shift. That day he ran into a roll-up door at the Lummis facility in Valero, causing significant damage to the door. Damage to the truck, however, was minor. [24]Finally, on June 7, McLaughlin once again demonstrated his carelessness by knocking down several mailboxes near the edge of the company's parking lot. There was damage to the mailboxes and minor damage to the truck. [25]Mr David Rossi stated that he had spoken with McLaughlin on several occasions about his driving record. He added that he had warned McLaughlin that three preventable accidents in one year could lead to his discharge, as indeed it should.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/20131201/2013-12(1)-P3.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":103203,"title":"What did the Lummis Accident Committee find out about the accident that occurred on March 13?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n原文中，其中the Lummis Accident Committee correctly determined that McLaughlin had been quite careless，“Lummis事故委员会确定McLaughlin（撞车是因为）太不小心了”，与D选项McLaughlin's carelessness resulted in the collision，“McLaughlin的粗心导致了撞车”构成同义替换，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The car driver was trying to avoid hitting a rabbit."},{"option":2,"content":"The car driver was partly responsible for the accident."},{"option":3,"content":"McLaughlin was talking to his manager while driving."},{"option":4,"content":"McLaughlin’s carelessness resulted in the collision."}]},{"id":103204,"title":"What did McLaughlin do on June 7 near the edge of the company’s parking lot?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词once again后面knocking down several mailboxes，“撞倒了好几个信箱”，与B选项构成视听一致。在6月7日的事故中，他在公司停车场附近撞倒了几个信箱，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He crashed into a car parked there."},{"option":2,"content":"He knocked down several mailboxes."},{"option":3,"content":"He tore down the company’s main gate."},{"option":4,"content":"He did serious damage to a loaded truck."}]},{"id":103205,"title":"What is most probably going to happen to McLaughlin?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n原文中lead to his discharge，“导致他被解雇”，与A选项中的He will lose his job，“他会丢掉工作”构成同义替换。McLaughlin的老板曾几次找他谈话，并警告他一年内发生三次可避免的事故足以解雇他，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He will lose his job."},{"option":2,"content":"He will have to pay damages."},{"option":3,"content":"He will be fined heavily."},{"option":4,"content":"He will receive retraining."}]}]}]}
