[26]Until recently, scientists believed that life on other planets was just a hopeful dream. But now they are beginning to locate places where life could form. In 1997, they saw evidence of planets near other stars like the sun. But scientists now think that life could be even nearer in our own solar system. One place scientists are studying very closely is Europa, a moon of Jupiter. [27]Space probes have provided evidence that Europa has a large ocean under its surface. The probes have also made the scientists think that under its surface Europa has a rocky core giving off volcanic heat. Water and heat from volcanic activity are two basic conditions needed for life to form. A third is certain basic chemicals such as carbon, oxygen and nitrogen. Scientists believe there might be such chemicals lying at the bottom of Europa’s ocean. They may have already created life or may be about to. You may wonder if light is also needed for life to form. Until recently, scientists thought that light was essential. [28] But now, places have been found on earth that are in total blackness such as caves several miles beneath the surface. And bacteria, primitive forms of life, have been seen there. So the lack of light in Europa’s sub-surface ocean doesn’t automatically rule out life forming.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/200912/2009-12-P1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102274,"title":"What did scientists once believe according to the passage?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词just后面life on other planets was just a hopeful dream“外星生命的存在只是一个梦”，与C选项Life was not possible in outer space“生命在外太空不可能存在”构成同义替换。直到最近，科学家们还认为其他行星存在生命是不切实际的幻想，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"There were no planets without moons."},{"option":2,"content":"There was no air or water on Jupiter."},{"option":3,"content":"Life was not possible in outer space."},{"option":4,"content":"The mystery of life could not be resolved."}]},{"id":102275,"title":"What have scientists found about Europa, a moon of Jupiter?

After the child had been treated and was being prepared for discharge, Dr. Myer talked to the parents about how they should care for the child at home. Also listening to her were a half a dozen other family members. [29]A few hours later, when she came to say goodbye, the family asked her to settle an argument they’d been having over exactly what advice she had given. “As I talked to them, I was amazed.” she said, “All of them had heard the simple instructions I have given just a few hours before, but they have three or four different versions. The most basic details were unclear and confusing. I was surprised, because these were intelligent people.” This episode gave Dr. Myer her first clue to something every doctor learns sooner or later----most people just don’t listen very well. Nowadays, she says, she repeats her instructions, and even conducts a reality check with some patients. [30]She asks them to tell her what they think they are supposed to do. She also provides take-home sheets which are computer printouts tailored to the patients’ situation. Dr. Myer’s listeners are not unusual. [31]When new or difficult material is presented, almost all listeners are faced with the challenge because human speech lacks the stability and permanence of the printed word. Oral communication is fast-moving and impermanent.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/200912/2009-12-P2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102277,"title":"What did the child’s family members argue about in the hospital?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词exactly后面what advice she had given“她（医生）给过什么建议”，与B选项What Dr. Meyer's instructions exactly were“医生的建议是什么”构成同义替换。亲属们就医生到底讲过什么建议争论不休，问医生如何解决，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Whether they should take the child home."},{"option":2,"content":"What Dr. Meyer’s instructions exactly were."},{"option":3,"content":"Who should take care of the child at home."},{"option":4,"content":"When the child would completely recover."}]},{"id":102278,"title":"What does Dr. Myer do to ensure her patients understand her instructions?

They are merely satisfiers. [32]Motivators, in contrast, include things such as having a challenging and interesting job, recognition and responsibility. [33] However, even with the development of computers and robotics, there’re always plenty of boring, repetitive and mechanical jobs and lots of unskilled people who have to do them. So how do managers motivate people in such jobs? [34]One solution is to give them some responsibilities, not as individuals, but as part of a team. For example, some supermarkets combine office stuff to people who fill the shelves, and the people who work at the checkout into a team, and let them decide what product lines to stock, how to display them and so on. Many people now talk about the importance of a company’s shared values or culture with which all the staff can identify, for example, being the best hotel chain, or making the best, the most user-friendly or the most reliable products in a particular field. [35]Such values are more likely to motivate workers than financial targets which automatically  only concern a few people. Unfortunately, there’s only a limited number of such goals to go around and by definition, not all the competing companies in an industry can seriously plan in to be the best.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/200912/2009-12-P3.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102280,"title":"What can actually motivate workers according to Frederick Herzberg?
