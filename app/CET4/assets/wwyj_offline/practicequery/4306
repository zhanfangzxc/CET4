For instance, some people believe that wearing glasses too soon weakens the eyes. But there is no evidence to show that the structure of eyes is changed by wearing glasses at a young age. Wearing the wrong glasses, however, can prove harmful. [27]Studies show that for adults there is no danger, but children can develop loss of vision if they have glasses inappropriate for their eyes.\n    We have all heard some of the common myths about how eyesight gets bad. Most people believe that reading in dim light causes poor eyesight, but that is untrue. Too little light makes the eyes work harder, so they do get tired and strained. Eyestrain also results from reading a lot, reading in bed, and watching too much television. However, although eyestrain may cause some pain or headaches, it does not permanently damage eyesight.\n    Another myth about eyes is that they can be replaced, or transferred from one person to another. There are close to one million nerve fibers that connect the eyeball to the brain, as of yet it is impossible to attach them all in a new person. [28]  Only  certain parts of the eye can be replaced. But if we keep clearing up the myths and learning more about the eyes, someday a full transplant may be possible.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/201106/2011-6-P1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102304,"title":"What does the speaker want to tell us about eyesight?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n文章开头处commonly held beliefs … that are not proven facts“不被证明事实的通常的信念”，与C选项false notions“错误认识”构成同义替换。短文开头提到有关于眼睛和视力的一些公认的看法并不真实，即人们对眼镜和视力有很多错误认识，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Its protection is often neglected by children."},{"option":2,"content":"It cannot be fully restored once damaged."},{"option":3,"content":"There are many false notions about it."},{"option":4,"content":"There are various ways to protect it."}]},{"id":102305,"title":"What do studies about wearing the wrong glasses show?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词but后面children … loss of vision“小孩会视力受损”，与C选项the loss of vision in children构成视听一致。如果小孩佩戴了不合适的眼镜，视力会受损，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It may make the wearer feel tired."},{"option":2,"content":"It will gradually weaken the eyes of adults."},{"option":3,"content":"It can lead to the loss of vision in children."},{"option":4,"content":"It can permanently change the eye structure."}]},{"id":102306,"title":"What do we learn about eye transplanting from the talk?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词only处Only certain parts of the eye can be replaced“眼睛只有某些部位可以移植”，与D选项only be partly accomplished构成同义替换，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It can never be done even with high technology.

If the caregivers are adult children, they are more likely to use such services, [29] especially because they often have jobs and other responsibilities. In contrast, a spouse, usually the wife, is much less likely to use support services or to put the dependent person in a nursing home. [30]Social workers discover that the wife normally tries to take care of her husband herself for as long as she can in order not to use up their life savings. Researchers have found that caring for the elderly can be a very positive experience. The elderly appreciated the care and attention they received. They were affectionate and cooperative. However, even when caregiving is satisfying, it is hard work. Social workers and experts on aging offer caregivers and potential caregivers help when arranging for the care of an elderly relative. One consideration is to ask parents what they want before they become sick or dependent. Perhaps they prefer going into a nursing home and can select one in advance. On the other hand, they may want to live with their adult children. [31]Caregivers must also learn to state their needs and opinions clearly and ask for help from others especially brothers and sisters. Brothers and sisters are often willing to help, but they may not know what to do.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/201106/2011-6-P2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102307,"title":"Why are adult children more likely to use community services to help care for elderly parents?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词especially 和because后面jobs and other responsibilities“工作和其他责任”，与D选项jobs and other commitments构成同义替换。因为成年孩子有工作和其他责任，所以他们更可能使用社区服务来帮忙照顾年迈的父母，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They think they should follow the current trend."},{"option":2,"content":"Nursing homes are well-equipped and convenient."},{"option":3,"content":"Adult day-care centers are easily accessible."},{"option":4,"content":"They have jobs and other commitments."}]},{"id":102308,"title":"Why are most wives unwilling to put their dependent husbands into nursing homes?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词in order to处not … use up their life savings“为了不用完她们的毕生积蓄”，与A选项don’t … to use up all their life savings构成视听一致。大多数的妻子不把他们的丈夫送进护理室是因为她们不想用尽自己的毕生积蓄，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They don’t want to use up all their life savings."},{"option":2,"content":"They fear they will regret it afterwards."},{"option":3,"content":"They would like to spend more time with them."},{"option":4,"content":"They don’t want to see their husbands poorly treated."}]},{"id":102309,"title":"According to the passage, what must caregivers learn to do?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词must后面state their needs and opinions clearly and ask for help from others“清楚的阐述自己的需要和想法，以及寻求其他人的帮助”，与C选项Be frank and seek help from others“坦诚而且向其他人寻求帮助”构成同义替换，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Provide professional standard care."},{"option":2,"content":"Be affectionate and cooperative."},{"option":3,"content":"Be frank and seek help from others."},{"option":4,"content":"Make full use of community facilities."}]}]},{"id":4302,"name":"2011.6 Passage Three","content":"    [32]Since a union representative visited our company to inform us about our rights and protections, my coworkers have been worrying about health conditions and complaining about safety hazards in the workplace.

The supervisor of the laboratory is beginning to get headaches and dizzy spells because she says it’s dangerous to breathe some of the chemical smoke there. [33]An X-rays technician is refusing to do her job until the firm agrees to replace its out-dated equipment. She insists that it’s exposing workers to unnecessarily high doses of radiation. She thinks that she may have to contact the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and asked that government agency to inspect the department. [34]I’ve heard that at a factory in the area two pregnant women who were working with paint requested a transfer to a safer department, because they wanted to prevent damage to their unborn babies. [35]The supervisor of personnel refused the request. In another firm the workers were constantly complaining about the malfunctioning heating system, but the owners was too busy or too mean to do anything about it. Finally, they all met and agreed to wear ski-clothing to work the next day. The owner was too embarrassed to talk to his employees.
