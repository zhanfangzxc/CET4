Feeding birds has become so popular that prepared feed mixtures are readily available. We feed birds for many reasons. Many pleasant hours can come from watching birds. A hobby often develops into a serious study of their habits. Accurate identification of birds is usually the first goal. But observations that an amateur bird-watcher can make are really limitless. [27]There is, however, responsibility associated with bird feeding, including a disease hazard. Attracting numbers of birds continually to the same spot can be harmful to them, particularly species that pick food from the ground contaminated by the droppings of other birds. In winter, feeding efforts are most satisfying to people and are of greatest benefit to birds. During this time when fewer natural foods are available and air temperatures are lower, extra feeding can keep a bird warm and well. Once begun, feeding should never stop during these lean months. If you start a local increase of birds, be prepared to do what may be required to eliminate hazards to those you want to be friend. [28]A constant supply of food should be given until the cold is over and spring has come. If feeding is stopped during severe weather, birds used to relying upon the feeders might starve.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/200906/2009-6-P1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102264,"title":"What does the speaker say about bird-watching?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n文章开头处entertaining“娱乐的”，与A选项entertaining构成视听一致，Speaker说观鸟是一项娱乐活动，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is entertaining."},{"option":2,"content":"It is a costly hobby."},{"option":3,"content":"It takes lots of time."},{"option":4,"content":"It requires training."}]},{"id":102265,"title":"What does the speaker say about birds fed continually on the same spot?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词however后面disease hazard“疾病危险”，与B选项disease构成视听一致，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They can harm nearby plants."},{"option":2,"content":"They may catch some disease."},{"option":3,"content":"They fight each other for food."},{"option":4,"content":"They may pollute the environment."}]},{"id":102266,"title":"What does the speaker suggest we do when feeding birds in winter?

Just 2 weeks ago, he was at my house when he decided he didn’t want to go into work. He called his boss and said he had to get a new set of tires to put on his truck. Then he sat down and watched TV with me. Not only had he lied but his excuse wasn’t a very convincing one. Another time, he cancelled a date with his girlfriend at the last minute telling her he had to get a new battery for his truck. [30]She was angry and refused to go out with him again until he apologized. Last weekend, Leo offered the poorest excuse yet. [31]He’d promised he’d help me move some furniture from my parents’ house to my new apartment. He was supposed to bring his truck over about 8 o’clock Saturday morning. I waited, and then called and left a message on his machine. About 11:30, he called and said he was sorry but he’d been getting a new set of tires put on his truck. I guess he’d forgotten he used the same excuse when he called his boss from my house. I think I need a new set of friends. I’m beginning to get tired of Leo’s excuses.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/200906/2009-6-P2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102267,"title":"What does the speaker tell us about her friend Leo?

Nobody wants to be old, unknown and poor. [32]For Hollywood kids, life can be difficult because they grow up in such an unreal atmosphere. Their parents are ambitious and the children are part of the parents’ ambitions. Parents pay for wasteful grand parties, expensive cars and designer clothes. [33]When every dream can come true, kids don’t learn the value of anything because they have everything. A 13-year-old boy, Trent Maguire, has a driver, credit cards and unlimited cash to do what he wants when he wants to. “One day, I’ll earn more than my dad!” He boasts. [34]Parents buy care and attention for the children because they have no time to give it themselves. Amender’s mother employs a personal trainer, a body guard, a singing coach and a counselor to look after all her 15-year-old daughter’s needs. Often, there is no parent at home most days, so children decide whether to make their own meals or go out to restaurants, when to watch television or do homework. They organize their own social lives. They play no childhood games. They become adults before they’re ready. Hollywood has always been the city of dreams. [35]The kids there live unreal lives where money, beauty and pleasure are the only gods. Will children around the world soon start to think the same?
