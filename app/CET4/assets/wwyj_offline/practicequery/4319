If the Great Depression is any guide, we may see a drop in our skyhigh divorce rate. But this won't necessarily represent an increase in happy marriages. In the long run, the Depression weakened American families, and the current crisis will probably do the same.\n    We tend to think of the Depression as a time when families pulled together to survive huge job losses. By 1932, when nearly one-quarter of the workforce was unemployed, the divorce rate had declined by around 25% from 1929. But this doesn't mean people were suddenly happier with their marriages. Rather, with incomes decreasing and insecure jobs, unhappy couples often couldn't afford to divorce. They feared neither spouse could manage alone.\n    Today, given the job losses of the past year, fewer unhappy couples will risk starting separate households. Furthermore, the housing market meltdown will make it more difficult for them to finance their separations by selling their homes.\n    After financial disasters family members also tend to do whatever they can to help each other and their communities. A 1940 book, The Unemployed Man and His Family, described a family in which the husband initially reacted to losing his job \"with tireless search for work.\" He was always active, looking for odd jobs to do.\n    The problem is that such an impulse is hard to sustain. Across the country, many similar families were unable to maintain the initial boost in morale(士气). For some, the hardships of life without steady work eventually overwhelmed their attempts to keep their families together. The divorce rate rose again during the rest of the decade as the recovery took hold.\n    Millions of American families may now be in the initial stage of their responses to the current crisis, working together and supporting one another through the early months of unemployment.\n    Today's economic crisis could well generate a similar number of couples whose relationships have been irreparably (无法弥补地) ruined. So it is only when the economy is healthy again that we'll begin to see just how many broken families have been created.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102443,"title":"In the initial stage, the current economic crisis is likely to __________.","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的current economic crisis定位到第一段前两句。\n解析：第一段第二句中we may see a drop in our skyhigh divorce rate，我们可以看到高离婚率有所下降，故正确答案是B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"tear many troubled families apart"},{"option":2,"content":"bring about a drop in the divorce rate"},{"option":3,"content":"cause a lot of conflicts in the family"},{"option":4,"content":"contribute to enduring family ties"}]},{"id":102444,"title":"In the Great Depression many unhappy couples chose to stick together because__________.","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的unhappy couples将本题定位于第二段最后两句。\n解析：定位句指出，with incomes decreasing and insecure jobs, unhappy couples often couldn't afford to divorce.

Facebook then attempts to make money by selling their data to advertisers that want to send targeted messages.\n    Most Facebook users don't realize this is happening. Even if they know what the company is up to, they still have no idea what they're paying for Facebook, because people don't really know what their personal data is worth.\n    The biggest problem, however, is that the company keeps changing the rules. Early on, you could keep everything private. That was the great thing about Facebook—you could create your own little private network. Last year, the company changed its privacy rules so that many things —your city, your photo, your friends' names—were set, by default (默认), to be shared with everyone on the Internet.\n    According to Facebook's vice-president Elliot Schrage, the company is simply making changes to improve its service, and if people don't share information, they have a \"less satisfying experience.\"\n    Some critics think this is more about Facebook looking to make more money. Its original business model, which involved selling ads and putting them at the side of the page, totally failed. Who wants to look at ads when they're online connecting with their friends?\n    The privacy issue has already landed Facebook in hot water in Washington. In April, Senator Charles Schumer called on Facebook to change its privacy policy. He also urged the Federal Trade Commission to set guidelines for social-networking sites. \"I think the senator rightly communicated that we had not been clear about what the new products were and how people could choose to use them or not to use them,\" Schrage admits.\n    I suspect that whatever Facebook has done so far to invade our privacy, it's only the beginning. Which is why I'm considering deactivating (撤销) my account. Facebook is a handy site, but I'm upset by the idea that my information is in the hands of people I don't trust. That's too high a price to pay.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102448,"title":"What do we learn about Facebook from the first paragraph?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的the first paragraph将本题定位于第一段。\n解析：该段第二句明确提到Facebook试图make money by selling their data to advertisers给广告商兜售用户的个人数据以获取利润，D选项中profit这里是动词，对应原文中的make money，故正确答案是D。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is a website that sends messages to targeted users."},{"option":2,"content":"It makes money by putting on advertisements."},{"option":3,"content":"It provides loads of information to its users."},{"option":4,"content":"It profits by selling its users' personal data."}]},{"id":102449,"title":"What does the author say about most Facebook users?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的most Facebook users将本题定位于第二段。\n解析：该段指出，Most Facebook users don't realize this is happening，大部分Facebook用户并没有意识到正在发生的事情这一切的发生。This指的是上文的“Facebook试图给需要向目标群体发送信息的广告商兜售用户的个人数据，以获取利润”，故正确答案是C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They care very little about their personal information."},{"option":2,"content":"They are reluctant to give up their personal information."},{"option":3,"content":"They don't know their personal data enriches Facebook."},{"option":4,"content":"They don't identify themselves when using the website."}]},{"id":102450,"title":"Why does Facebook make changes to its rules according to Elliot Schrage?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的 Elliot Schrage将本题定位于第四段。\n解析：题干中询问的是 Elliot Schrage对于其公司改变隐私规则的解释，第四段开始就明确指出the company is simply making changes to improve its service，公司作出改变只是为了改善服务。C中的render better service对应原文中的improve its service，故正确答案是C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"To conform to the Federal guidelines."},{"option":2,"content":"To improve its users' connectivity."},{"option":3,"content":"To render better service to its users."},{"option":4,"content":"To expand its scope of business."}]},{"id":102451,"title":"What does Senator Charles Schumer advocate?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的Senator Charles Schumer将本题定位于第六段。\n解析：该段第二句指出参议员Charles Schumer called on Facebook to change its privacy policy，呼吁Facebook改变它的隐私政策；urged the Federal Trade Commission to set guidelines for social-networking sites督促联邦贸易委员会为社交网站设定指导原则。B中的Formulating regulations对应原文中的set guidelines，故正确答案是B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Setting guidelines for advertising on websites."},{"option":2,"content":"Formulating regulations for social-networking sites."},{"option":3,"content":"Banning the sharing of users' personal information."},{"option":4,"content":"Removing ads from all social-networking sites."}]},{"id":102452,"title":"Why does the author plan to cancel his Facebook account?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的 Facebook account将本题定位于最后一段。\n解析：最后一段第一句指出作者怀疑无论 Facebook已经做过什么侵犯我们隐私的事情，这还只是个开始，然后第二句说这也是他正在考虑注销其他账户的原因。由此可见，作者注销账户的原因是不想隐私被侵犯，也就是说作者不想自己的个人信息被社交网站滥用，故正确答案是C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He finds many of its users untrustworthy."},{"option":2,"content":"He is upset by its frequent rule changes.
