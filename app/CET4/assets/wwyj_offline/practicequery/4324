[26]Aaron, for example, is single, and earns a very good salary. Her friend, Pat, a divorced mother of three, is struggling to make ends meet. [27]“We are both frequent theater-goers,” Aaron explains, “and I'd gladly pay for two tickets, just to have Pat's company at plays in concerts, but she won't go anywhere unless she can pay her own way. I hate to go alone, so we both stay home. It all seems so silly.” Pat sees the situation differently. After an unhappy marriage to a man who tried to control her without considering her wishes and feelings, she says, “it's very important to me to carry my own weight. I'm not comfortable in any relationship where all I do is take.”\n     The difficult situation finally changed when Aaron moved recently. Pat's children were with their father, so she took a picnic lunch to her friend's new place, then spent the day helping her unpack and get settled. “I was so grateful,” Aaron says, [28]“that I persuaded Pat to let me return the favor in my own way with season tickets to our little theater group. I think she's beginning to recognize that she contributes as much to our friendship as I do.”","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/20121201/2012-12(1)-P1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102333,"title":"What do we learn about Pat?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n原文中struggling to make ends meet“勉强量入为出”，与B选项not well off“不富裕”构成同义替换。Pat是个带三个孩子的单身母亲，勉强维持生计，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"She is not good at making friends."},{"option":2,"content":"She is not well off."},{"option":3,"content":"She enjoys company."},{"option":4,"content":"She likes to go to concerts alone."}]},{"id":102334,"title":"What draws Aaron and Pat together?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n原文中We are both frequent theater-goers“我们俩都经常去剧院”，与C选项common interest“共同的爱好”构成同义替换。共同的兴趣爱好让二人经常在一起，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Their similar social status."},{"option":2,"content":"Their interdependence."},{"option":3,"content":"Their common interest."},{"option":4,"content":"Their identical character."}]},{"id":102335,"title":"What does Aaron do to return Pat's favor?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词that后面season tickets“季票”，与D选项season tickets构成视听一致。Aaron对于Pat的帮助非常感激，为Pat买剧院季票作为回报，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Invite Pat to a live concert."},{"option":2,"content":"Buy some gifts for Pat’s kids."},{"option":3,"content":"Help take care of Pat’s kids."},{"option":4,"content":"Pay for Pat’s season tickets."}]},{"id":102336,"title":"What do we learn about friendship from the passage?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n文章开头处We don’t choose friends on the basis of how much money they have“我们不会根据钱多钱少来选择朋友”，与A选项It can develop between people with a big difference in income“收入差距很大的两个人也能成为朋友”构成同义替换，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It can develop between people with a big difference in income."},{"option":2,"content":"It can be maintained among people of different age groups."},{"option":3,"content":"It cannot last long without similar family background."},{"option":4,"content":"It cannot be sustained when friends move far apart."}]}]},{"id":4328,"name":"2012.12 (Passage Two 卷一)","content":"    Sun School in the town of Ashbert in England is a day school for children aged 10 to 18. [30]It is based on the value of social equality between students and staff, and has few rules. Sun School believes that the healthy growth of a child is more important than academic success. It offers a variety of lessons and activities for students to choose from and free time for children to follow their own interests. Classes are small, and based on the individual needs of each child. The timetable is fixed, but democratically decided, and students are expected to attend. The weekly school meeting is at the center of the way Sun School is organized. It makes all the decisions that affect the school, including rules, the timetable and accepting or rejecting new students and teachers. [31]Participating in these meetings gives children an understanding of democratic decision-making and helps them develop their skills of argument and persuasion. The most important advantage of the school meeting is that it shows the children that the school is really theirs. They have the right to decide on changes. And the school’s success or failure depends on their decisions and their behavior. Sun School employs no cooking or cleaning staff. These jobs are done by students and teachers. Decorating and simple repairs are also done by the students. It is believed that for the school to truly belong to those who use it, [32]they must take responsibility for its maintenance.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/20121201/2012-12(1)-P2.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102337,"title":"What value is Sun School based on?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n原文开头处social equality between students and stuff“学生与教职员工之间的社会平等”，与C选项构成视听一致。Sun School的办学价值观是以学生和员工之间的社会平等为基准，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Priority of students’ academic achievements."},{"option":2,"content":"Equal education opportunities to all children."},{"option":3,"content":"Social equality between teachers and students."},{"option":4,"content":"Respect for students’ individuality."}]},{"id":102338,"title":"What is characteristic of the school’s decision-making process?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n原文中democratic“民主的”，与D选项构成视听一致。学校在做决策时体现的一个特点就是民主，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Efficient."},{"option":2,"content":"Complicated."},{"option":3,"content":"Lengthy."},{"option":4,"content":"Democratic."}]},{"id":102339,"title":"Why does Sun school ask the students to do its maintenance?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词must后面take responsibility“承担责任”，与D选项take responsibility构成视听一致。学校让学生负责校园的维护，是为了让他们学着承担起责任，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"To help them acquire hands-on experience."},{"option":2,"content":"To try to cut down its operational expenses."},{"option":3,"content":"To provide part-time jobs for needy students."},{"option":4,"content":"To enable them to learn to take responsibility."}]}]},{"id":4331,"name":"2012.12 (Passage Three 卷一)","content":"    [33]Well, to continue, as I mentioned earlier, there is also research that demonstrates that individuals perform worse, not better,  on tasks when other people are there. R. W. Harburt did an interesting experiment. He had his subjects learn a finger maze. This is a game in which you indicate with your finger the way through a complex system of passages or paths. The subjects who had an audience did worse than the subjects who did alone.\n    Now how can we explain these very different results? It seemed very confusing for a long time. Social psychologist, John Roberts, finally cleared up the confusion about why people sometimes perform better and sometimes worse in front of an audience. Roberts found that the presence of an audience facilitates what [34] you already know how to do. That is, if you know what you are doing, having an audience helps you do it better. But if you don’t already know how to do something, you will probably make some mistakes and you will make mistakes for a longer time if you have an audience. That’s exactly what happened to the subjects who were learning the finger maze.\n    So, if you are doing well, having an audience increases the chances that you will continue to do well. If you are doing badly, having an audience increases the chances that you will continue to do badly. Roberts cleverly pointed out that when you are first learning something, [35]you are better off working alone than practicing with other people.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/20121201/2012-12(1)-P3.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102340,"title":"What did the speaker probably discuss before coming to this part of the talk?","textExplain":"本题考点为合理推测。\n通过关键词worse和not better处also research that demonstrates that individuals perform worse, not better on tasks when other people are there“也有研究表明人们在有他人在场时，把事情做得更糟，而非更好”，可推知Speaker之前讨论了人们在有他人在场时把事情做得更好的情况，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The best way to work through a finger maze."},{"option":2,"content":"Individuals doing better in front of an audience."},{"option":3,"content":"Researchers having contributed greatly to psychology."},{"option":4,"content":"Improvements on the classification of human behavior."}]},{"id":102341,"title":"When does the presence of an audience facilitate your performance according to Roberts?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n原文中you already know how to do“你已经知道如何做某件事”，与C选项构成视听一致。当你已经知道如何做某件事时，有人在场会让你把这件事做得更好，即C为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"When you feel encouraged by the audience."},{"option":2,"content":"When you try to figure out a confusing game."},{"option":3,"content":"When you already know how to do something."},{"option":4,"content":"When you complete with other people in a group."}]},{"id":102342,"title":"What does Roberts think is a better way to learn new things?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词better … than处working alone“独自练习”，与B选项Working by oneself“自己练习”构成同义替换。Robert说当你初次学习某件事情时，最好先独自练习，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Practicing constantly."},{"option":2,"content":"Working by oneself."},{"option":3,"content":"Learning by doing."},{"option":4,"content":"Using proven methods."}]}]}]}
