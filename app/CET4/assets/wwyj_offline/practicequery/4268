Did he get pensioned off at last?\nM: Yes. [19]They made him retire after 50 years at sea. He is pretty upset about it, but what can you do? He really is past it.\nW: He is all alone, isn’t he?\nM: [20]Yes, his wife’s been dead for years. They had one daughter, Dories. But she went off to town as soon as she left school. And he hasn’t heard from her since. I hear she is making good money as a model.\nW: Maybe someone could get in touch with her. Get her to come back for a while to help?\nM: I don’t suppose she come. [21]She never got on with her father. He is a bit of a tough character and she is rather selfish. Oh, I expect old Jake will get by. He is healthy at least, comes into the clinic for a check regularly.\nW: Are you his doctor?\nM: No, my partner doctor Johnson is.\nW: That bad-tempered old thing?\nM: [22]Oh, he isn’t really bad-tempered. He just looks it. He is an excellent doctor, taught me a lot, and he has a very nice family. His wife invites me over there to supper every week. Very pleasant.\nW: Yes. I teach their daughter Pen at school. She is a bit careless and lazy about her school work, but a bright little thing and very popular with her age group.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/200906/2009-6-C1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102180,"title":"Why does old Jake look terribly depressed?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n男士话中retire“退休”，与B选项no longer work“不再工作了”构成同义替换。Jake沮丧是因为他退休了，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"His health is getting worse."},{"option":2,"content":"He can no longer work at sea."},{"option":3,"content":"His past life upsets him a good deal."},{"option":4,"content":"He has not got the expected pension."}]},{"id":102181,"title":"What do we learn about Jake’s wife?
