I don’t think they are much better than comics on film, if you know what I mean.\nM: Yes, sure. And a few years ago, they were certainly like that. [19] But they’ve got a lot better now.\nW: Yes, and historical films—that’s what I really like. I never miss a good film set in Middle Ages. Oh, and love stories—I never miss one on TV.\nM: Funnily enough, I don’t like those kinds of films at all. But to come back to this one, I personally didn’t think it was very good. It certainly wasn’t as good as other science fiction films I’ve seen.\nW: Wasn’t it?\nM: No, not at all. [20]Oh, the effects were very good.\nW: Yes, I thought they were marvelous, especially the battle in space, incredible.\nM: Yes, but I was going to say I thought the acting was terrible.\nW: Yes. I suppose Jason was too good to be true. And what was the name of the baddy?\nM: Cargon?\nW: Yeah. Cargon was really evil, wasn’t he? But I suppose that’s what these films are all about—good triumphing over evil. [21]And the characters have to be black and white.\nM: Well, yes, but not always. War of the Worlds wasn’t like for example. Anyway, you enjoyed the film. That’s the most important.\nW: Yes, I did.

So we start at 6: 30 and then it goes on until the 9 o’clock.\nM: And what was your reason for wanting to do the class?\nW: Well, I just bought my first car and I don’t know anything about cars.

Do you bring the car along to the class?\nW: Yes, we do. [24]And in the first part of the lesson, the first half hour, the man who runs the class will go through some particular part of the car, and we’ll learn about it. And then we spend the rest of the time, actually working on my own cars, the same problem.\nM: And how many people are there in the class?\nW: [25]Um, I think 16, but 3 quarters of them are women. It’s quite interesting because the man is obviously used to teaching men.
