If I had first met Joe as a freshman in high school we wouldn’t even have had the chance to get to know each other. Joe is a day student, but I am a boarding student. We haven’t been in same classes, sports or extracurricular activities. [27]Nonetheless, I spend nearly every weekend at his house and we talk on the phone every night. This is not to say that we would not have been compatible if we had first met in our freshman year. Rather, we would not have been likely to spend enough time getting to know each other due to the lack of immediately visible mutual interests. In fact, to be honest, I struggle even now to think of things we have in common. But maybe that’s what makes us enjoy each other’s company so much. When I look at my friendship with Joe, I wonder how many people I’ve known whom I never disliked, but simply didn’t take the time to get to know. [28]Thanks to Joe, I have realized how little basis there is for the social divisions that exist in every community. Since this realization, I have begun to make an even more determined effort to find friends in unexpected people and places.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/201206/2012-6-P1.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102324,"title":"Why does the speaker say Joe Ganz became one of his best friends?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词first后面met Joe Ganz when we were both nine years old“与Joe Ganz相识的时候两人都是九岁”，与B选项known each other since childhood“从小就认识”构成同义替换，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They shared many extracurricular activities."},{"option":2,"content":"They had known each other since childhood."},{"option":3,"content":"They shared mutual friends in school."},{"option":4,"content":"They had many interests in common."}]},{"id":102325,"title":"Where does the speaker spend most of his weekends?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词every后面at his house“在他家”，与B选项At Joe's house构成视听一致。Speaker几乎每个周末都会去乔的家，即B为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"At a local club."},{"option":2,"content":"At Joe's house.

His research in the neighboring town had taken longer than he expected. It was late and he was very tired when he drove home. [29]He turned into his building’s parking lot, but all the spaces were full. He drove back out onto the street, looking for a parking space. The first block was full. The next block was almost empty. Lewis didn’t see a “no parking” sign, but he had expected that if parking were allowed there, most of the spaces would be filled. Then he saw a small parking lot with two free spaces. He was so glad to see them that he didn’t even think to read the sign by the entrance. He drove in, parked and hurried home to go to bed. The next morning he went back to the lot to get his car. It was gone. [30]He ran home and telephoned the city police to say that his car had been stolen. It took the police only a minute to tell him what had happened: his car had been on a private lot. It had been taken away by the police. [31]Lewis had to take a taxi to the city garage far from the center of town. He had to pay a fee of 40 dollars to get his car back.

It’s one of those things we all recognize when we see it, but we don’t really understand what it is. We seem to feel that some people are naturally creative, but we don’t know how they got that way. Is creativity a natural gift like good looks, or is it something that can be acquired like knowledge? Perhaps if we analyze the creative process carefully, we might get some insight into what it is and how it might work in our lives. [33]The creative process has always been accepted as the source of all important work in the arts, but we should not think the creativity plays a role only in the arts. [34]Every major scientific discovery began with someone imagining the world to look differently from the way others saw it. And this is what creativity is all about--imagining the world in a new way. And despite what you may believe about the limits of your own creative imaginations, we all have the potential to imagine the world in an absolutely new way. In fact, you are born with it. It is your birth right as a human being. [35] And what’s more, you use it every day, almost every moment of your life. Your creative imagination is what you use to make sense of your experiences. It’s your creative mind that gets meaning from the chaos of your experiences and brings order to your world.","audioUrl":"http://v.yingshibao.chuanke.com/CET4_new_audio/201206/2012-6-P3.mp3","questionJson":[{"id":102330,"title":"What did the speaker most probably discuss last time?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n文章开始处creativity … mysterious“神秘的创造力”，与D选项mysteriousness of creativity“创造力的神秘性”构成视听一致。Speaker上次谈论了创造力的神秘性，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Creativity as shown in arts."},{"option":2,"content":"Famous creative individuals."},{"option":3,"content":"A major scientific discovery."},{"option":4,"content":"The mysteriousness of creativity."}]},{"id":102331,"title":"What is the widely accepted idea about the creative process?","textExplain":"本题考点为视听一致。\n关键词always后面the source of all important work in the arts“所有重要艺术作品的来源”，与A选项the source of all artistic work构成视听一致。创造力历来就被视为所有重要艺术作品的创作源泉，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is the source of all artistic work."},{"option":2,"content":"It starts soon after we are born."},{"option":3,"content":"It is something people all engage in."},{"option":4,"content":"It helps people acquire knowledge."}]},{"id":102332,"title":"What leads to major scientific discoveries according to the speaker?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n原文中imagining the world to look differently“与常人不同的方法看待世界”，与D选项Creative imagination“创造性想象力”构成同义替换。重大科学发现来源于创造性想象力，即D为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Natural curiosity."},{"option":2,"content":"Critical thinking."},{"option":3,"content":"Logical reasoning."},{"option":4,"content":"Creative imagination."}]},{"id":106014,"title":"What does the speaker imply about the creative process?","textExplain":"本题考点为同义替换。\n关键词And what’s more后面every day…every moment of your life“每一天，生命中的每一刻”，与A选项everyday life“每天的生活”构成同义替换。人们在生活中每时每刻都在发挥自己的创造力，创造力是人们日常生活的一部分，即A为正确选项。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It is part of everyday life."},{"option":2,"content":"It is a unique human trait."},{"option":3,"content":"It is yet to be fully understood."},{"option":4,"content":"It is beyond ordinary people."}]}]}]}
