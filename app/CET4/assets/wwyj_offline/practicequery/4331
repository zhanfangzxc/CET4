For a student like me who considers any class before noon to be uncivilized, getting to a factory by 6 o’clock each morning is torture. My friends never seem to understand why I’m so relieved to be back at school or that my summer vacation has been anything but a vacation.\n    There’re few people as self-confident as a college student who has never been out in the real world. People my age always seem to overestimate the value of their time and knowledge. In fact, all the classes did not prepare me for my battles with the machine I ran in the plant, which would jam whenever I absent-mindedly put in a part backward or upside down.\n    The most stressful thing about blue-collar life is knowing your job could disappear overnight. Issues like downsizing(裁员)and overseas relocation had always seemed distant to me until my co-workers told me that the unit I was working in would shut down within six months and move to Mexico, where people would work for 60 cents an hour.\n    After working 12-hour shifts in a factory, the other options have become only too clear. When I’m back at the university, skipping classes and turning in lazy re-writes seems too irresponsible after seeing what I would be doing without school. All the advice and public-service announcements about the value of an education that used to sound stale now ring true.\n    These lessons I’m learning, however valuable, are always tinged(带有)with a sense of guilt. Many people pass their lives in the places I briefly work, spending 30 years where I spend only two months at a time. “This job pays well, but it’s hell on the body,” said one co-worker. “Study hard and keep reading,” she added.\n    My experiences in the factories have inspired me to make the most of my college years before I enter the real world for good.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102463,"title":"How did the author look back on his summer days while at college?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的look back和at college定位到首段最后一句。\n解析：在第一段最后，作者明确提出他的暑假has been anything but a vacation, 根本算不上假期，可知他的暑假很辛苦，故正确选项为B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They brought him nothing but torture."},{"option":2,"content":"They were no holiday for him at all."},{"option":3,"content":"They were a relief from his hard work at school."},{"option":4,"content":"They offered him a chance to know more people."}]},{"id":102464,"title":"What does the author say about college students?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的college students定位到第二段前两句。\n解析：文章第二段第一句提到，There’re few people as self-confident as a college student who has never been out in the real world，很少有人像从来没步入真实社会的大学生一样自信。隐含的意思是大学生过于自信。C中的think too highly of是文中overestimate的同义转述，故正确选项为C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They expect too much from the real world."},{"option":2,"content":"They have little interest in blue-collar life."},{"option":3,"content":"They think too highly of themselves."},{"option":4,"content":"They are confident of their future."}]},{"id":102465,"title":"What, according to the author, is most frustrating for blue-collar workers?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的most frustrating定位到第三段第一句。\n解析：文章第三段第一句指出，The most stressful thing about blue-collar life is knowing your job could disappear overnight，蓝领工人生活中压力最大的事情是知道自己可能会一夜之间丢掉工作，即他们对自己的工作没有安全感，故正确选项为B。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They do not get decent pay."},{"option":2,"content":"They do not have job security."},{"option":3,"content":"They have to wok 12-hour shifts."},{"option":4,"content":"They have to move from place to place."}]},{"id":102466,"title":"In what important way has the author’s work experience changed him?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的work experience和changed定位到第四段第二句。\n解析：定位句中skipping classes and turning in lazy re-writes seems too irresponsible after seeing what I would be doing without school，作者在经历过校外的工作经验之后，认识到逃课和怠学是不负责任的行为，可知作者开始认识到学业的重要性了，故正确选项为D。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"He learned to be more practical."},{"option":2,"content":"He acquired a sense of urgency."},{"option":3,"content":"He came to respect blue-collar workers.

Are they exhausted by the consumer equivalent of the brain fatigue—information overload—that is caused by constant updates of devices and online media?\nUnderwrites Laboratories issued a report last week that found 48% of consumers “feel high-tech manufactures bring new products to market faster than people need them.”\n    There are two possible explanations. The first, obvious one is that the pace of innovation(创新)is too fast for consumers. The second, less obvious one is that, in fact, innovation is too slow. That is, the new offerings companies are pushing out the door every six months or so are me-too products or ones with just a couple of new features. Marketing schedules, not product innovation, are driving the corporate(公司的) train. Manufactures in America valued “speed to market” more than in other countries, the report found.\n    Sara Greenstein, Underwriters Laboratories’ chief strategy officer, offered her interpretation of the survey results, “Innovation is too fast only if corners are cut.”\n    For the high-tech sector, there are a few other interesting findings. Consumers are less concerned about safety in high-tech products than categories like fresh and processed food. But their top safety concerns are emissions and wireless radio waves. Many people, it seems, are uneasy living in a thickening cloud of radio waves from mobile phone towers and the gadgets they communicate with.\n    A finding that was a bit surprising is that to consumers, the inner parts of high-tech devices do apparently matter. Some 55% of consumers, according to the report, said they are “more concerned about where high-tech components come from than where the product was assembled.”\n    The report doesn’t really say how that information would affect consumer buying decisions. It could be complicated. Manufacturing companies on average rely on more than 35 contract suppliers around the world to create a single product. That number would be higher for a smartphone or laptop.\n    But maybe some sort of supply-chain labeling showing where parts come from in a product? “We’re working on it,” Ms. Greenstein said.","audioUrl":"","questionJson":[{"id":102468,"title":"What is the finding in Underwriters Laboratories’ report about many consumers?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的finding 和Underwriters Laboratories’ report定位到第二段第一句。\n解析：第二段提到美国保险商实验室发布的一项报告指出，48% of consumers feel high-tech manufactures bring new products to market faster than people need them，48%的消费者认为高科技制造商向市场投放新产品的速度快于人们的需求度。即他们认为产品更新速度比人们所需快，故正确选项为C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"They are exhausted by the information overload."},{"option":2,"content":"They are tired of the constant updating of devices."},{"option":3,"content":"They feel products are updated faster than needed."},{"option":4,"content":"They have difficulty following high-tech innovations."}]},{"id":102469,"title":"What does the author mean by “me-too products”?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的me-too products定位到第三段第四句。\n解析：文章第三段第四句指出各公司每隔半年左右退出的新产品是mo-too products or ones with just a couple of new features，后者意为“仅有很少新特征的产品”，也可以理解为“没有很大区别的产品”，故正确选项为A。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":1,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"Products with no substantial difference."},{"option":2,"content":"Products tailored to individual users."},{"option":3,"content":"Products everyone is eager to possess."},{"option":4,"content":"Products companies complete to make."}]},{"id":102470,"title":"What do American businesses give priority to when marketing their products?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的American business, give priority和marketing定位到第三段。\n解析：文章第三段最后一句提到，Manufactures in America valued “speed to market” more than in other countries，美国制造商比其他国家的制造商更加注重“加快进入市场的速度”。也就是说，美国优先考虑的是向市场投放产品的速度，故正确选项为B。 ","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":2,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"The constant updating of their technology."},{"option":2,"content":"The speed of putting them on the market."},{"option":3,"content":"The quality of their new products."},{"option":4,"content":"The pace of product innovation."}]},{"id":102471,"title":"What is the consumers’ chief concern about high-tech products?","textExplain":"定位：由题干中的chief concern, high-tech products定位到第五段第三句。\n解析：文章第五段提到了消费者关心的一些问题，第三句说But their top safety concerns are emissions and wireless radio waves，他们最关心的安全问题是辐射和无线电波，故正确选项为D。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":4,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"User-friendliness."},{"option":2,"content":"Product quality."},{"option":3,"content":"Place of assembly."},{"option":4,"content":"Radio emissions."}]},{"id":102472,"title":"Why does the author suggest supply-chain labeling?","textExplain":"定位： 由题干中的supply-chain labeling定位到文章第六段段第一句（the inner parts of high-tech devices）。\n解析：文章第六段最后一句提到more concerned about where high-tech components come from than where the product was assembled，消费者更关心高科技组件的来源地而不是产品的组装地，即消费者会留意产品标签上的信息故正确选项为C。","videoExplainUrl":"","rightOpt":3,"userOpt":0,"answerJsons":[{"option":1,"content":"It guarantees the safe shipping of products."},{"option":2,"content":"It promotes the competitiveness of the supplier."},{"option":3,"content":"Consumers care about where components are made."},{"option":4,"content":"Consumers tend to buy products they are familiar with."}]}]}]}
